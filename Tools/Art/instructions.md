The .obj files generated by Gaea 2 are too dense and don't extend to the horizon.
This self-contained Blender scene lets you optimize them with a simple process. 

All you need to do is:
- Run the script (just click "Run script ►" in the Text Editor window)
- Select the OBJ file exported by Gaea 2
- Hit "Export"

The script generates:
- terrain.fbx (main terrain mesh)
- terrain_skirt.fbx (background mesh stretching to horizon)
