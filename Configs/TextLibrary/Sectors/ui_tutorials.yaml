      To destroy structures, you'll need to use a weapon with structure damage. Look for a line like this in the damage summary:

      Once you're happy with your choice, proceed to the mission. If something goes wrong, you can always go back to the auto-save before the fight and adjust your build.

      Pay close attention to the level of each piece of equipment. Parts of a higher level will let your mechs face stronger enemies, as damage and health are scaled with your mech's overall level.
