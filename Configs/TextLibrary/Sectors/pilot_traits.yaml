name: Pilots (Traits)
description: Traits are a concept similar to upgrades/abilities/perks acquired by characters in most RPG games. Pilots acquire traits when they level up, randomly get some traits when they are first generated by the game or experience certain events. A trait can be a simple stat boost (+5 health) or something that unlocks a complex new ability tied to a specific trigger condition (e.g. ability to dodge incoming hits for five seconds following a collision in combat). Traits descriptions should mostly follow the pattern of "this pilot is special in the following way". The mention of the pilot can be omitted and implied if localizing to a language where pilot gender is a factor, as we won't be able to implement gendered variations for these strings.
