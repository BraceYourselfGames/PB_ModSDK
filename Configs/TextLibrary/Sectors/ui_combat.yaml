  targeting_coverage:
    color: 
    noteDev:
      text: This term refers to proportion of the scatter cone of your weapon being intersected by average target size. This is a bit technical, but to give an example - a sniper rifle with very narrow scatter cone has coverage of 100% at all distances, because average target size is much larger than the cone bullets travel in. A weapon like a shotgun only remains at 100% coverages over a short distance, then drops sharply. The bullets start out close together, but quickly separate by 2,3,4,5 meters and so on. Once bullets separate by 5 meters (average target size), coverage begins dropping from 100%. This term is important to advanced players who optimize their firing distances.
