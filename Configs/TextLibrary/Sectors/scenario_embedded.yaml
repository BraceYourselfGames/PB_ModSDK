description: All text unique to specific scenarios. Core header/text are only visible in developer menus for the time being. States are akin to objectives, their header/text usually describe what needs to be done or consequences of something happening. Steps are similar to narrative event steps, but can include a lot more data - aside from standard header/text strings, they can also include strings for tutorial intermissions, contextual hints etc. State/step text that repeats more than oncecan be found in scenario_states_shared or scenario_steps_shared sectors.
