description: Workshop project variants cover common modifications shared between many different projects. For example, each weapon project might have a unique description in the project sector, but might offer the player a choice between 3 quality levels, and text for these quality levels will be defined in this sector.

      text: 'This set of variants controls quality level / rating of an item that will be built. This is similar to loot rarities in many RPGs: blue/green/purple loot in Destiny, WoW, Diablo, etc. The descriptions cover how these rarities affect performance in our game.'

  prt_body_ratings_starter__rating_1_name:
    noteDev:
      text: This is text for a special version of the quality selector where common quality costs nothing to produce but has no perks at all. For example, basic armor and basic rifles are free to build, but we want uncommon and rare variants of same models to be as expensive as other uncommon and rare item types. The description currently doesn't reflect this distinction, but we might alter it in the future to point out what makes "starter" parts different from normal "common" parts.
