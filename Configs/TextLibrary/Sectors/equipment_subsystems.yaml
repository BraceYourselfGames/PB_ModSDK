description: Names and descriptions of individual subsystems. Presented by UI when you hover over subsystem slot (hardpoint) or when you inspect individual subsystem in an inventory list. Since subsystem database is a tree where each config can inherit from another config, this sector can contain names and descriptions associated not just with bottom-most configs in the chain, but with higher level configs as well (Vidar or Arm etc.). When a part preset matches multiple pieces of text, they get joined and presented together.
