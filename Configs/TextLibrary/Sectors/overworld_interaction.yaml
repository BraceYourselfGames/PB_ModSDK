      The enemy is still reeling from your attacks in Hedmark. Press the advantage, identify vulnerable targets, and open up a path to the mountains. The ground you gain here will be a safe haven for your allies and civilians fleeing the occupation.


      The tactical map lights up with enemy signatures. You've reached hostile territory; It's time to pick your next target.

      The path through the mountain could be perilous. After a short debate with your crew, you decide that the best course of action is to deal with the occupying forces on this side of the ridge. This should give you a chance to salvage extra equipment and gain more experience before attempting the pass.


      The first enemy signatures appear on your map. It looks like Kaskad has a formidable presence in this province, but after the previous battle, your pilots are brimming with confidence.
  arrival_campaign_10_breakthrough__s_step_01_main:

      You approach the Western Pass, a long valley carved from the surrounding mountain range. It's the only path large enough to accommodate Kaskad's heavy cargo crawlers, which carry reinforcements and valuable supplies through the pass daily.


      Hitting this artery would hurt. Cut off from the rest of Fyrland, the remaining forces this side of the Sunset Walls will be forced to retreat. With no alternate routes through the mountains, taking this chokepoint would seal your recent gains.
  arrival_campaign_11_open_start__s_step_01_main:
    noteDev: 
    temp: false
    text: >-
      You leave the Western Pass behind. With the path through the mountains cut off behind you and the 3F standing guard, it will be nearly impossible for Kaskad to resupply their outposts in the outer provinces.


      Now, you turn your attention east, towards the heart of Fyrland. Here, the occupation is more entrenched — but with the equipment and experience you've already gained, your pilots are feeling more optimistic than ever.
  arrival_campaign_12_open_mid__s_step_01_main:
    noteDev:

      The crew is in high spirits. You receive word that the 3F has been growing in number and making steady gains across the country. There are even rumours of unrest in the Capital, where Kaskad has been working hard to supress any news of your progress.


      But you can't afford to lose focus. Kaskad has undoubtedly been drawing plans to strengthen their ranks and retake the liberated territories. Only constant pressure from the resistance can prevent that from happening.

      To your sides, mountain peaks disappear into low clouds. The narrow, winding valley ahead is another ideal defensive position. Thanks to supply lines beginning to run from liberated provinces, the resistance could hold the ground here, even against a massive enemy force.


      But Kaskad has seen the opportunity as well. Ahead, your scanners pick up a stronghold with layered defences, a communications array, and — most worrying — an unidentified Behemoth patrolling the valley. Claiming the pass might take some creativity.

    noteDev:

      You glance at the tired faces around you. Multiple Kaskad squads lie in wait outside the pass, making navigation a nightmare. Repeatedly pushing them back has only concentrated their forces.


      Your driver has managed to evade the worst of it, and 3F held the line behind you. But between the rough terrain, drones buzzing overhead, and constant gunfire in the distance, tensions remain high. The battles you face are only going to intensify as you draw closer to the Capital.

    text: Victory is almost within reach, but there's still much work to be done. You will need to take out the strongholds in the region to pull forces away from the Capital. With enough pressure, they'll spread themselves too thin and expose a route into the city.

    noteDev:

      According to 3F intel, the province ahead is a target-rich environment. Kaskad forces entrenched themselves here early in the occupation, resulting in a large number of high-ranking officers, elite squads, and strategically important bases in the region.


      It's going to be a challenge, but the risk will be worth it: if the 3F can take control of the province, it could open up a direct route to the Capital.

      You're in the Outer Provinces for now. It is an isolated region cut off from the rest of the country, surrounded by near impassable mountain ranges.


      The main route to the rest of Fyrland is the Western Pass. If you cut the enemy supply lines and manage to block the pass, the Outer Provinces can be held by the resistance forces.

      Everyone is in high spirits: two provinces liberated in such a short time feels like a miracle. It will prove to be a short-lived mirage if you don't keep up the momentum. The enemy is complacent and slow to react, but they will react. They will bring their full might to crush this rebellion, and they will succeed unless the resistance has an easily defendable chokepoint.


      You'll chase them all the way to the Western Mountains, you'll take their stronghold, and you'll see the counterattack crumble against its walls. It is just a matter of time.

      It's early morning. The enemy has spent a frantic night preparing for an all-out attack on their citadel, seemingly safe on the far side of the river. Every street has been barricaded, bridges have been raised, and mechs patrol every inch of the downtown core.


      But you won't need to get to the citadel; all you need is a clear sightline.

      A flare cuts through the sky, and then another. Within minutes, you start receiving reports: throughout the city, Kaskad forces are standing down. With their headquarters reduced to ash, frantic requests for orders are going unanswered. Slowly, they begin to surrender.


      As the 3F mobilizes to help the injured, you close your eyes and — for a moment — allow your adrenaline to turn to relief.

      The base comes to a stop as it crests the hill, pausing for a few minutes to scan the surroundings. The sun is about to rise, the air is eerily still. You step outside to take in the view.


      The Capital. A sight you've known since childhood. But even from here, you can see the skyline marred by a massive structure towering over the downtown core: Kaskad's base of operations.


      "That thing's ugly, huh?" says one of your pilots. "I vote we get rid of it."

      Inside that citadel is the beating heart of the occupation: the Kaskad officials who were so confident that, in time, you'd accept their subjugation. Who were so sure that they'd come out of this unscathed.


      The radio crackles with constant updates. Fyrland Freedom Forces are deploying along the city's perimeter, preparing for what everyone hopes to be the final battle.


      You know exactly what to do and where to go. This is your home.

      The engineers hastily explain that, for some time now, the 3F has been dismantling the Behemoths defeated by your squad. Armour was repurposed for defensive measures, salvaged reactors were used to stabilize the power grids of liberated territories.


      However, the weapons were largely scrapped, deemed impractical without a mobile platform and a massive power supply. But over time, the capacity of your crawler has significantly improved.

      Your mobile base has navigated through every type of terrain, overcome every obstacle. It's stronger than it's ever been. And all the upgrades done to the reactor might make it possible to power one of the Behemoth's own weapons, if only for a single shot.


      Your crew gets to work immediately. They're ecstatic at the prospect of giving the mobile base a weapon worthy of its strength — for example, a high-energy beam with a range of a several kilometres.


      The enemy citadel looms in the distance. Begging to be target practice.

      Fyrland Freedom Forces report that they've successfully spoofed the Behemoth's navigation signal and sent it barrelling towards the enemy stronghold. Kaskad units are scrambling to intercept it, but stopping it completely will be nearly impossible.


      The autonomous Behemoth will still pose a threat, but the upcoming collision should damage both it and the base enough to make securing the pass a real possibility.

      The battered cargo carrier slowly rolls to a stop. Fyrland Freedom Forces are already moving in to salvage the wreckage and set up a defensive perimeter. It's safe to say that Kaskad won't be moving anything through the pass anytime soon.

      You come across a massive concrete tunnel disappearing into the hillside, likely another entrance to the mining complex. The driver, visibly relieved, jumps out of their seat and rushes downstairs to check the suspension. The old metal beast has been surprisingly cooperative so far, but after years in storage, there's no shortage of things for your engineers to check.


      "Should we check out the mine?" asks one of your pilots. "Considering our proximity to Langset, there might still be some equipment inside."

      You peer out at the vast stretch of land before you — despite years of occupation, it still feels like home.


      A pilot points to a spot on the map directly ahead of you: Langset, one of Fyrland's remote outposts, now under Kaskad's command. And, if your intel can be trusted, home to a mobile base currently undergoing repair.


      It's time to make your move.
