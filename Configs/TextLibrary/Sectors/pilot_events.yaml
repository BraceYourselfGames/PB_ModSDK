description: Text for various gameplay events that can be tracked by pilots. Pilots have abilities and traits that can be affected by or triggered by any of these events, so it is necessary to have localized names for them to allow the UI to surface appropriate notifications (for instance, alertig the player that a pilot activated an ability because an enemy was hit).
