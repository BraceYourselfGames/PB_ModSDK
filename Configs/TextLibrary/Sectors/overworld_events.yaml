description: Text in the event pop-ups players encounter on overworld map. Includes overall name for the event, header and body of each step, and header and body of each custom option. All event text keys are prefixed with "ev_". Since options can be reused in multiple steps, so they are listed after all step text, not mixed together. Some options are reused across multiple events - for instance, very generic responses like "Cancel", which shouldn't be duplicated per event (you can find them by looking for "os_" prefix instead of event name).

      PLACEHOLDER PB encounters a civilian who offers them a salvaged, albeit heavily damaged black box recorder from a downed invader mech. Upon inspection, the mechanics in the PB state they can salvage either a collection of secret codes, or coordinates to a secret location but NOT both due to the damage incurred on the recorder.


      If a defector is present in the PB, there is a chance they will point out that the black box damage was deliberate, and not caused by the heat of battle.PLACEHOLDER

      The Home Guard agent nods to you in greeting.


      “Good to see you again, Commander,” he says. With the conscripts rescued and safely home, he looks more energetic than before. Perhaps even a little younger. “Take care of our friend, will you? Brigade now or not, our people are still our people. It’s tough to see ‘em go, sometimes.”


      As the new pilot is guided toward the base by one of your scouts, you salute them, thanking them for placing their trust in you.

      A scout comes to a stop at your side, bearing a message.


      “Do you remember the army agent who contacted us about those conscripted civilians? Well, it looks like they’ve got a pilot in their ranks that wants to join up with the Brigade,” they say. “An army-trained pilot might be a good asset…we should really think about it, I say.”

      Irregular mounds of grass dot the field before you. Your scouts, ever-vigilant, report their readings: the thin layer of soil hides angled sheets of metal, destroyed mechs resting under the earth. The telltale signs of a battlefield have grown over so thoroughly that a casual glance could almost miss what happened here.


      Sweeping away the soil and grass reveals downed Home Guard mechs. By the damage, it’s clear the pilots didn’t have a chance to eject. Oppressive silence descends.


      A pilot among your crew recognizes the unique armor. They brush a hand over a string of serial numbers and bow their head, suddenly frozen by grief. “This was my Home Guard unit,” they whisper.

      Up in the sky, blackbirds flock in tight, coordinated patterns, going nowhere fast. Your youngest pilot points at their acrobatics, saying, “It’s amazing they don’t run into each other.”


      A frantic clatter from within the mobile base draws everyone’s attention. Two pilots have taken up rags to polish the feet of their mechs. The birdwatcher, puzzled, asks what they’re doing.


      “Blackbirds form murmurations to shake predators,” one of the experienced pilots explains. “It’s bad luck to witness one before a battle. The enemy could lock onto your location and trail you. Best way to banish the bad luck is by polishing up your mech’s feet.”


      The young pilot can’t find a rag fast enough.

      Thinking better of it, you pull your team away from the stranger and his wares. He quickly shrugs off his disappointment and mutters something about cheap window shoppers. Spit hits on the ground at your back as you walk away.


      Back on the mobile base, you give the order to prepare for a raid, and the base erupts into a flurry of motion.


      There’s no reason to let this opportunity pass you by.

      Your scouts come back from their survey, and rattle off their reports.


      “Most of the goods are intact,” says one, thumbing through the data on her pad, “though not all of it is going to be of use to us, of course. But there’s a lot here we can use.”


      “We can be on our way whenever you need, boss,” says the other. “All is in order. They won’t be setting up shop here again anytime soon…”


      You nod, and send them on their way. Your work here is done.

      A group crowds around the strange container in the command room. At your order, one of the technicians crouches over it and gets to work. No one breathes when the latch pops apart, when the lid creaks open…


      “Damn it! It’s a bomb–and it’s [i]live[/i]!”


      Every face around you is tight with tension. Murmurs ripple across the group.

      Someone from the factory approaches you. A worker with a weathered, smiling face. He hauls a crate behind him, and as you peer past his shoulder into the open top, you see several bottles of alcohol packed tightly together.


      One of your pilots whistles at the sight, and the man laughs.


      “We don’t have much to give you,” he says. “But we do have some good vintage stocked up for an occasion like this. Here, it’s all yours, Commander.”


      The crate gets taken to the base, and your pilot turns to you with a hopeful eye.

      “Oh, this is the [i]good[/i] stuff, Commander,” remarks one of the techs. He holds a bottle up to the light and whistles. “You know the factory that used to make this stopped operations years ago? This is probably worth a lot…”

      As you make your rounds in the mobile base, you hear some of the veteran pilots murmuring amongst themselves from an open door.


      "No way, you had Captain Groesmeyer as your pilot instructor too?"


      "I don't miss them as a training officer, that's for certain."


      "They definitely run a mean course. Were you around when..."


      Trading war stories is a must-have culture in any unit, and the Brigade is no exception. The pilots are reminiscing over simpler times when training was just that, and not a prelude to war.

      You’ve successfully struck into the center of the Capital, but there is no time to rest and repair. This is your only chance for a brief reprieve. The beating heart of the enemy’s command is so close now. However enemy reinforcements still remain that will fight you to the last mech.


      There is an opening to slip back into the shadows, to lick your wounds and sharpen your steel once more. The Home Guard is prepared to do the same.


      One of your pilots is staring into the camera, unable to tear their eyes from the chaotic comms. “Decision’s on you, boss.”

      Victory in the Capital is just out of reach. Falling back is the best call, but it leaves a bitter taste. The occupying defenders are vicious and well-trained, and they’ve turned your nation’s heart into a mighty fortress. There is no shame in retreating from that.


      As the crawler bay doors close, you take note of how many of your mechs made it back. Burnt cordite and scorched metal smell more pungent with a defeat like this. But this is only a battle lost, not the war.


      Next time will be different.

      The odor of sulfur, smoke and dirt linger in the air; a blinding red glow streaks over the Capital, a second sun sent up by the Home Guard. The radio traffic confirms the intention of the signal flare; retreat.


      Artillery curtains your withdrawal, the rear doors to the crawler close with a heavy thud as you take off at full speed. Whatever the cause of your withdrawal, the Home Guard will be ready again when you are.

      One of your mechs helps you onto one of the taller buildings still standing in the Capital. The peak gives you an unrestricted panorama of the sea of broken mechs across the city. You hold your country’s flag in one hand.


      You have successfully liberated the Capital. Relief is palpable in the air, mixed with the bitter taste of smoking metal.


      Looking at the wreckage, it is obvious that the cost of liberation is high, but paying off the debt of oppression is priceless.


      You take another look at the horizon, ready to hoist the flag and declare victory over the invading forces.

      Congratulations, Commander! You’ve successfully liberated the Capital!


      Once you have finished your celebrations, there’s still work to be done. Rebuilding can’t be completed until all the remaining pockets of occupiers have been ferreted out of the remaining provinces. But the Home Guard will be awarding you new resources as a reward for your instrumental moves in the Battle of the Capital.


      Continue your campaign to liberate your country, and see what else Phantom Brigade has to offer!

      The base comes to a stop, one of your mechanics having detected an issue with the engine. The crew take this time to stretch their legs and get some air.


      When you prepare to set off again, a scout comes back with a metal box cradled in his arms, caked in dirt. It was buried near a tree, he tells you.


      It’s a time capsule, filled with mementos from strangers in a time long past. Photos. Letters. Even a diary. All put together by a group of young friends long before the occupation. There is no telling where any of them are now, if they knew what the future held in store for them.


      The mechanic looks through the letters with a faraway look on her face. “What should we do with it, boss?”

      You gesture for the mechanic to put the contents of the capsule away for safekeeping. Those people may be long gone, but it wouldn’t hurt to keep their memories with you as you travel.


      You are fighting for the future of the homeland, for a life that only these buried ghosts remember. Perhaps as they are watching over you, they might even bring you luck.

      It takes some time to find something fitting, but once the proper tribute is found, the decision is unanimous to add it to the capsule. Perhaps their spirits can rest in peace knowing the Brigade will carry on the mission they made the ultimate sacrifice for.


      As the scout buries the capsule again, one of the pilots muses aloud to who will find it next, and hopefully if they will understand the cost of war, and the price for freedom.


      The toll for conflict is almost certainly steeped in blood, but you and the crew know that the memories of your fallen won't be in vain.

      The mechanic awaits your response, her fingers tracing the edge of a yellowing photograph. You turn to the scout and tell him to put everything back where it was.


      “Probably better that way,” murmurs the mechanic. “It almost feels like bad luck to unearth them in times like these, you know? The world’s supposed to be better than they left it, after all…”


      She hands it over to the scout before turning back toward the base, and you watch the scout bury the box back into the dirt.

      Most of your pilots, other than the one most invested, do work while they wait. But after a couple of hours, the one watching the barn waves you all over.


      "Do you hear that?" they whisper to you.


      And sure enough, you hear a strange high-pitched cry coming from the barn. It's quiet, but it's definitely inhuman. You also hear some scratching on the wood.


      The skeptical pilot backs away. "Maybe we shouldn't mess with this."


      "I thought you didn't believe in ghosts!" says the excitable one.


      "I don't! But still, better safe than sorry…"

      You and your pilot approach the barn slowly, ready for any surprise. The high-pitch cries have stopped, but the scratching continues.


      As you get closer, your pilot motions for you to stay put while they duck inside one of the rotted holes in the wood. Then you hear them laughing.


      They appear a second later, with a little bundle of ginger in their hands.


      "It's a kitten!" they exclaim. "Must've been left behind by their mother and been making a racket in there, poor thing."


      "Well, the dog won't like this," says one pilot when you get back to the base. "But we can try and get them to be friends. You'll be a good little kitty, won't you?"


      They boop the kitten's nose and, in agreement, the kitten purrs.

      When your pilot returns, they are very excited about what they've learned.


      "This is called the 'haunted province' by locals," they tell you. "And she said that there's been an increase of ghost activity since the occupation began! In fact, she's heard about a barn that people refuse to go near at the moment because of a poltergeist! Can you imagine?"


      "What a load of rubbish," another pilot remarks.


      "Come on! Don't you think we should check it out?"

      The Defector peers at the battle data from the last fight, and makes a low sound in her throat.


      “I recognized one of the enemy pilots. They’re conscripts from this province.”


      “They’re putting our people on the front lines? Despicable!” spits one of your mechanics. He turns to you, expression worried. “I know we didn’t do well in that last bout, boss, but…I’m not too keen on a re-match if it’s our people we’re fighting.”


      “Your countrymen have been conscripted everywhere. Backing out now won’t change anything because there’s always going to be more,” the Defector argues, but the mechanic ignores her.


      You catch her eye as he storms off, and she simply shrugs.


      “It’s war. Don’t let it keep you up at night.”

      "Hey Commander, we just got the intel back on this region," he says. "The enemy troops here are much tougher than anything we've dealt with before."


      Behind him, your other pilot says, "We can try to beat them, but we put people at more risk by trying to be heroes than by leaving here and coming back when we're better trained."


      "What do you reckon, boss?" your driver calls from the front. "Up to you."

      You are observing the outpost from your base when the director taps your shoulder.


      “This is a premium shooting location,” he says. “Look at that scenery! [i]This[/i] is the battle we’ve been waiting to film, my dear Commander. Our crew will be observing you when you rush in!”


      Once again, he assures you that they will be keeping their distance from the fight itself, only connected to you via headset. You can see how excited he is to start filming.

      You escape the hot zone with the civilian crew in tow.


      “My, er...Commander, I…”


      The director looks shell-shocked, his eyes wide. His shirt is soaked through with sweat and the camera in his hand creaks from the tightness of his grip.


      “I’m truly sorry. None of us...we didn’t know it could be like that.” His breath trembles out of him. “We didn’t know.”


      There is nothing you can say, and eventually the director and his crew set out back out onto their travels. Briefly, you wonder what will become of the footage. But soon enough, other matters demand your attention, as they always do.

      “That was incredible, my dear commander,” the director breathes, feverishly rewatching the footage on his device. “I almost can’t believe that was all spontaneous. Just splendid. The tactical expertise! Those reaction times! The brigade just elevated my film to new heights. This will be the foundation of our country’s new [i]cinematographic history[/i]!”


      He hurries off, his crew at his back. Your pilot sighs.


      “People like that think it’s all fun and games, don’t they? Pure sensationalism. They should be glad no one got hurt.”


      You shrug, letting the pilot vent. Perhaps the film really will be as good as the director claims.


      ...And if it is, you just might catch the matinée.

      You regroup, and the film crew approaches your team as you patch yourselves up. For the first time since you’ve met, the director’s eyes are downcast, and none of the cameras are rolling.


      “I...hadn’t realized,” he says, unnaturally somber, “what it all looks like up close. The kinds of things you see every day.”


      He takes a deep breath. “Our footage came out of the fight intact, so you know. We’ll be proceeding with the film...it will be going a different direction than I planned, but...well. The people should know your story.”


      As they depart, the film crew drags their equipment with them with heavier steps than before.

      As you peer out of the base at the passing scenery, a group of civilians walking along a path and carrying bulky equipment catches your eye. When the base draws nearer, their leader waves for you to stop.


      “Salutations! Greetings! [i]Et cetera[/i]! Would you grizzled-looking mercenaries happen to be wading into some explosive, high-octane firefights in the very near future?”


      Confused, you ask what he means.


      “We’re documentarists, and I am the director,” he says, proudly, “and our film about the occupation is certain to go down in history. It’ll be in classrooms and theatres and homes everywhere - and we are ever in search of [i]quality[/i] material. If you would be so kind as to give us a lift - and of course, we will compensate you for your time - we would be happy to tell you more about our vision!”


      Your pilot mutters under their breath. “Oh no…”

      You and your pilot share a look.


      “Oh, you [i]are[/i]! Hey, listen -” the director yells at his observing crew. “It’s the Brigade! Right in our laps!”


      The air around you ripples with whispering. The director stares at you with frenzied awe.

      You ask for more information. What sort of documentary is it? Surely it isn’t so important that they’re risking their lives just to capture some footage?


      The director’s eyes shine. “History is compiled [i]after[/i] the battles by those lucky enough to survive the fire, my dear Commander! We’re just getting ahead of the curve, this time around. If we aim to create art that will change the course of history, we must put ourselves in the line of fire! Just as you do every day, Phantom Brigade!”


      “Artistic types, I swear…” whispers your pilot.


      “Say,” the director snaps his fingers, suddenly energized. “How would you like to be the star of the show?

      It's quiet on the road and you stop to let the pilots stretch their legs. Before you return to the base, though, one of your pilots comes bounding up to you, a bundle in her arms.


      "Look what I found!" she cries. "He was just wandering around out here, no collar, no owner, no nothing."


      The bundle shifts, and two black eyes look up at you. The ball of fur looks to be a Samoyed dog. It barks once, then pants happily. He must only be a few years old and his ears twitch expectantly as he looks up at you.


      "Can we keep him?" your pilot asks. Her ears are practically twitching too. A few other pilots have come over to look what's going on and are now cooing at the dog. "I promise he won't make a fuss! Look at what a good boy he is!"


      She and a few of the other pilots look at you, waiting for your answer.

      In the town, the Samoyed your pilot adopted starts to yip excitedly.


      "What's up, boy?" your pilot asks, applying liberal amounts of head scritches. "Caught the scent of something?"


      Instead of replying, the dog bounds out of the mobile base before anyone can stop him. By the time you've caught up to him, he is wrapped in the arms of a townsperson, who looks delighted.


      "You've found it, you found my Tomas!" the townperson says. He cuddles the dog close. "He ran away, after our home was destroyed and we needed to move somewhere safer. I never thought I'd see him again!"


      Your pilots are doing their best to look pleased, but you can tell they're a little bummed.

      With the Home Guard forces following several paces behind you, your team approaches the stopover point.


      You’ve got the drop on them! It looks like half of their units are out on patrol, and the ones left guarding the convoy are unaware of you.


      “We’ve got the army backing us up. If we go in head-on, the enemy won’t be ready for us,” says your pilot.


      Your radio crackles as the Home Guard agent adds, “But if you want a quieter approach, our units can cause diversion and split the remaining forces that are guarding the convoy. This means fewer enemies the Brigade has to deal with...and we get to keep the villagers out of harm’s way”


      “Your call, boss, but make it soon,” your pilot nods. “The patrol will be due back at any moment.”

      “Didn’t think you’d show, but we’re grateful you did,” he says. “Now, here’s the situation...”


      A Home Guard spy recently uncovered a plan to draft citizens from the homeland into the enemy army. Now, they’ve gotten word of a village that’s been raided nearby, with villagers packed aboard a convoy headed to the border.


      “Our intel states they’re going to make a stop en route, which would be a good time for an ambush,” he says, drumming his fingers on the base of his rifle. “Only problem is, we don’t know the precise time. You could end up running into a fully fortified camp.”

      You pull your forces out. Again. Frustration makes your temples pulse.


      The agent approaches you with a frown.


      “We’re grateful the Brigade lent us a hand, Commander,” he says, gruffly. “But we’ll have to handle this ourselves from here. We’ve been rallying folks from all over and finally got in contact with some government exiles, and will be making our push soon. You should get some rest.”


      Out of habit, he gives you a salute, though his attention is drifting from you even before his arms drop back down.


      “Safe travels, Brigade. Maybe we’ll meet again.”


      You leave the army to their planning, your footsteps heavy.

      Storms were on the forecast today, but nothing like this. Lightning shatters the sky white, striking close and shaking the earth. Rain blurs your surroundings to white noise. If not for the electrical storm, you might be able to navigate by your sensors, but no luck.


      You’re contemplating the best course of action when the mobile base goes abruptly dark. Disgruntled and concerned murmurs rise from the crew. The lights flicker back up on emergency power, and red lights are flashing on the charging mech reactors.


      Well. That narrows your options.

      You hear voices from the corner of the mech bay. It’s one of your mechanics, staring at the row of pilot lockers. By her side is a senior mech engineer, and there is a box of personal effects at their feet.


      “...They knew what the risks were,” says the engineer.


      “Is that supposed to make it better?”


      He shrugs, his expression pinched. “Maybe.”


      The mechanic sighs. “I’m just tired of saying goodbye, is all. I don’t want to bury any more friends.”

      When they arrive, the kids immediately run inside to check if any of their toys have been moved, and the farmer and her husband come to you.


      "Thanks," she says. "We have little to repay you with, but we will be sure to tell our neighbors about how much the Phantom Brigade helped us here."

      "They took my farm! They took everything!" she cries.


      One of your pilots makes her a nice cup of tea and when her nerves are settled, you ask her to explain.


      "They kicked us out of our farm! I tried to fight them, but they threatened my family if we didn’t clear out. We've been walking for days, and have nowhere to go. That farm was our life and livelihood."


      Her family, she tells you, are staying in an abandoned barn nearby, but she came out when she heard the base rumbling through.

      One of the luxuries of liberation is the return of festivities. As your team rests near a settlement they helped free, you notice a lot of activity starting up.


      In the town square, there are stalls selling fluffy potato pancakes slathered in lingonberry jam and steaming bowls of curry filled with dumplings. Others sell caramelized nuts and other sweet treats, and others still have handmade crafts.


      "It's our Festival of Fire," a civilian declares when a pilots asks. "We couldn't have it during the occupation, so now we're finally free to put it on!"


      "You can stay, if you like," her partner says to you. "We'll light a bonfire soon and there are some great fire dancers performing later."

      A long, soulless sigh leaves the pilot. After what feels like an eternity of silence, they turn to face you.

      Bases are the most challenging military structures to defeat. Be sure that you're ready before you attack. It's wise to tackle roaming units in neighboring regions before choosing to assault a base in some cases.


      You've received intel that units in this base are using brand new technology: regenerative armor. This armor is capable of absorbing damage over and over if left undisturbed for more than a few seconds. It might be worth focusing your fire on one mech at a time to prevent this.

      “Leave them alone for more than a couple seconds and they’ll absorb all the damage you deal out like it’s nothing,” a Home Guard scout reports as you near the enemy base. “We’ve been focusing on one mech at a time in order to take them down.”


      Worrying news, but forewarned is forearmed. Your crew is disciplined enough that you note their reaction only in the pilots’ exchanged glances.


      You run through a final check with your crew. This will be the greatest challenge the Brigade has faced so far. Preparation is everything.

      Word of victory brings contagious joy. Even your most stoic mechanic breaks into a teary grin upon your return from battle. When one of your pilots does a celebratory shuffle in their mech—giant metal feet scraping across the earth—you don’t even have the heart to lecture them. You know the war will be tough, and some of your crew are so young. You let their relieved laughter wash over you, a pressure valve released.


      Ahead, there may be grim days. For now, in this moment, there is hope.

      As thanks, one of the farmers gift you a mech they modified themselves. They unfused the core, responsible for power and heat capacity, from an enemy mech body. They also found a few spare cores that you can try. Each core subsystem has trade-offs and benefits.


      The higher the quality of the mech, the more internal auxiliary subsystems it contains. In many cases, high-quality parts have their internals unfused. Unfused subsystems can be replaced with other subsystems of the same type.

      “We can’t go in there guns blazing as usual,” a pilot says to another. “This isn’t a base or a battlefield. These are people’s homes.”


      That brings up a list of things to contend with. It doesn’t matter if you liberate the civilians if they have nowhere to live after the smoke clears.


      Now comes the test of all your strategizing and training.

      Though the Brigade was defeated, the day wasn’t lost. Your efforts weakened the invaders enough for the Home Guard to push out remaining enemy forces.


      You hear the words among your huddled crew: “We have to get back out there.”


      They won’t let go of their hope so easily. Good. The road ahead is long. They must learn to pick up the pieces and move forward in whatever way they can.

      One of your pilots leaps down from their mech, face flushed from the heat of battle and the high of victory. “Let’s prove these liberator rumors true!” they call out, raising cheers from the rest of the crew.


      A grueling journey lies ahead of you, but the role of hope cannot be forgotten. It has sustained the civilians this long and under these conditions. Perhaps it can sustain you too.


      If you can secure this province, what’s stopping you from taking back your homeland?

      The crew discovers an enormous, heavily fortified vehicle in the base. Inside, there’s ample space to accommodate pilots and crew, complete with a bay to house mechs. It’s creaky from disuse, but still otherwise intact.


      You run your hand along the surface of its enormous tire treads, and at your side, an engineer breathes in awe, “I never thought I’d see one of these in person…what a [i]find[/i]!”


      With this mobile base, you’ll be able to take the fight out onto the road—striking the enemy when they don’t expect it, and even outfitting your mechs out in the field. This will take your campaign a long, long way.

      Felheim base. Once a mining facility, later retrofitted as an emergency storage depot—then the invaders came, and like everything else, it fell into enemy hands…


      “You’re thinking it too, right?” asks your pilot, grinning. “If we can capture the facility, we’d have a home base to fall back to, if we needed it. It would get us a foothold in the province [i]and[/i] hit ‘em hard while we’re at it!”


      It's an opportunity you can't pass up. The battles ahead will challenge you, and shape the country's future. You need to take every advantage you can get.


      And it all starts with Felheim.

      Silence commands the mobile base, with each scout, mechanic, and pilot staring down the map in the command room. Before you can reclaim the province, one last fight awaits you.


      A marker hovers over the site of the enemy base—the largest military installation in the region.


      The Home Guard alerts you that they’re on their way, the crackle of the comms startling three of your crew out of their thoughts. Together, you will strike as a single unit. Everyone dashes to their stations, only the most necessary words passing among them. The base lurches into motion, the hope of victory and liberation propelling you forward.

      With your recent efforts, for now the civilians are safe. However, your numbers are too small to permanently hold the area. Ensuring the people’s continued safety means calling in Home Guard forces before the invaders can reoccupy.


      You’ve built up enough momentum to contest the province and take back control. When you deliver the news to your crew, they buzz with a mix of anticipation and nerves. This was always your goal.


      You might be a small rebel unit, but with your prediction tech, you could help turn the tide of a war.

      “Get this—that commander the Home Guard’s been after, his patrol just broke down.” Your scout points to a location on the map. “Now’s the time to mount an ambush.”


      Upon hearing the news, one of your pilots begins nervously drumming their fingertips against the control panel. “If we hit ‘em hard now and manage to get their commander, he won’t be able to lead troops back into the villages,” they say, their tapping intensifying. “We free the people for real.”

      An unusual silence falls over the workshop. Your habitually busy engineers are idle, and their tools tossed aside out of frustration. The quartermaster waves you over, and the stern expression on his face tells you there’s a serious issue.


      “Can’t work like this, boss.” He holds out the hose end of a gel dispenser-an invaluable tool for keeping mechs on their feet. “No gel, no repairs.”

      After a victory like that, you’re no doubt on the invading army’s radar. Good. Hopefully eliminating a key target in the province will wither their resolve. These invaders should know that the Phantom Brigade is here—and here to stay.

      The radio crackles. Everyone holds their breath.


      “Reactor secured, Commander!”


      The scout next to you collapses into her chair, her face slack with relief. Footsteps beat the floor, and the base swells with noise as the crew jumps into action. There are post-mission sweeps to do, check-ins to complete…


      You look at the reactor in the distance, whole and stable.


      And then you move on.

      One of your scouts cuts in, looking frantic. “Hey, wait, she’s still in there!”


      “She’ll be in more danger if we stick around!”


      As the base powers up, the analyst turns back to you. “We can mount a rescue once things calm down, boss. But right now, our proximity will just make the situation worse.”

      Your pilot roped in the rest of the squad to help, and they carefully reconnect the power lines. After a few gruelling hours, the sound of electricity whirring back to life reaches them.


      The man who reported the problem comes out of his house looking very pleased indeed.


      "Thank you," he says. "It would have been a lot harder for us to fix without those mech suits!"


      "It was our fault, it was only right we fixed it," your pilot says.


      "We'll be singing the Brigade's praises, that's for sure!" he says, and hands you some bottles of cold beverages. "These are a small token of our appreciation."

      Now it's your squad's turn to be embarrassed. One of your pilots turns to you, red-faced.

      When the enemies are gone, when the initial shock has left most of the crew numb, the base returns to the smoldering aftermath of the battle. One of your scouts, fresh from the countryside and bruised by this first harsh reality of war, keeps insisting that maybe the pilot survived the blast, that you should go back and check, that maybe you couldn’t see their ejection through the smoke, that maybe…


      Witnessing the damage to the cockpit isn’t enough to convince the scout. They burst through the base doors, slipping in the muddy tracks a tank left behind, to throw themself at the lost pilot’s mech. They’re so small next to the fallen metal giant, and when there’s no response from within, they fall silent.

      You frown, remembering that day’s failure. Had you succeeded, perhaps this could have been avoided.

      Her fingers move through the stash lightning fast–and the further she gets, the heavier her frown becomes.


      “As I thought…these are codes, Commander. I don’t have the cipher so I can’t decode them for you, but if you deliver these, you’d be handing intel directly to enemy spies stationed at the delivery point.”


      Your scout, who had been watching in curiosity, backs away in alarm.

      You give your scout the go-ahead to open the odd container.


      Inside is a large bundle of envelopes, the paper in surprisingly good condition. They are covered in postage stamps, marked for addresses all over the country.


      “I guess someone’s missing their mail,” murmurs the scout. “But other than that…I don’t think there’s anything special about these. We can just leave ‘em, I think.”


      “Is there a post office nearby?” asks your mechanic, crouching to take a look. “If it’s on the way then we may as well hand it off.”


      The scout shrugs. “What do you say, Commander? Up for playing courier?”

      You approach with caution, but the coast is clear.


      There are more abandoned mechs here than you could see from the road, and they seem to be getting more numerous the further away from the road you get.


      "Oh, I know where we are!" your pilot exclaims. "I heard there were some memorials from the old war out here, but I've never seen them."


      "If we have time, I'd love to pay my respects," another says.

      You come upon a quiet memorial. At the center, a slab of concrete has the names of fallen pilots etched into it. On the ground, helmets are scattered and weeds grow through the burned out cracks in them.


      You and your pilots scramble out of the mobile base, and have a moment of silence.


      When it's passed, one of the pilots leans over to you and asks, "What do you wanna do now, boss?"

      As your mobile base trundles towards the Memorial, you hear a commotion upfront. It looks like some enemy troops have set up shop in the Memorial, creating some kind of base here.

      One of your pilots calls out for the mobile base to stop. In the field you're passing, the wreckage of a mech lies surrounded by scorched earth and twisted metal.


      "It's got our flag, but doesn't look like one of ours, boss," she says. "Must be an old model."


      Grass has grown over parts of it and it looks in a terrible state, but you'll need to get closer for a proper look.

      The Home Guard agent hums over the radio.


      “Mineral refinery? Sure, sounds familiar. We went a few rounds with a scouting group around there, months and months ago. Lot of tunnels in that area...I’ve got a good idea of where they’d set up a cache, actually. Security forces, too. We’ll send you the data, and some backup if you’re planning a strike.”


      “Thank you,” says your scout. “We owe you one!”


      “Take the enemy out and bring those people their livelihoods back, and you can consider the favor repaid.”


      He disconnects. You get to work.

      Your scout gets the defector on the line, explaining the situation.


      “Ah! Yes, that does ring a bell, actually,” you hear her rifling through her documents even through the radio. “Yes! My information might not be up to date, but I do have coordinates to a hidden cache and data on the security formations. I’m sure this will help.”


      You scout thanks her, quickly writing down the information onto a piece of paper. “Whenever you’re ready, Commander. Let’s take back that stash!”

      As you stop in town to stock up on supplies, you see a group of protestors gathered by a run-down mineral refinery. Asking around, you are led to the group’s leader, a stocky older man with wind burnt skin.


      “They came overnight. Told us that a third of our stock was to be sent to supply chains, making weapons,” he says. “A third became half, and then half became all of it. We can’t do business anymore. This town knows nothing else.”


      Later, your scout hands you a map, pointing to a road. “Most convoys have to pass through this area on the way out of the province. If we can grab those minerals back from them, somehow, then we have a shot at really hurting their supply lines.”

      Later in the day, your scout comes back, cheeks flushed from running. She points to a spot on your map.


      “I found a hiker in the town! Says he saw some tunnels around here. He couldn’t get close because scouts in the area ran him off, but it seems like the invaders might have a cache to store the minerals. We still have no intel on security or layout, however…”


      You glance over at the refinery. The protest leader clutches a megaphone and shouts to a crowd.

      The rain outside hasn't let up for hours. Luckily, the mobile base's wheels are able to deal with the thick mud of the country roads.


      Not everyone is so well-equipped though, and you come across a tractor that has gotten itself stuck. The woman driving it is splattered in mud and looks exhausted.

      Night air breezes through the open bay doors, and with it appears the missing pilot—barefoot, their hair and clothes soaked through—smiling.


      “You look drowned, mate,” says a mechanic, her frown skeptical.


      The pilot regales them with a story of their evening walk, a moonlit glade, and a silver lake. By the end, a puddle has formed at their feet. They shiver and, as if a spell has been broken, the crew moves again. A mechanic hands them a mop.

      After the raspberry incident, the pilot is never tardy, but they remain eccentric in the way they pass the time.


      One evening, you watch them circle a tree three times, rip up a handful of grass, and throw it over their shoulder. On a midday break, you witness them rise from a field with an entire flower crown braided into their hair. They sleep in it, leaving a trail of crushed petals through the mech bay.


      “Wow, you really are from Brostland, huh?” comments a scout.


      But no one teases them. Soon, you spot other pilots joining them in their tree circling rituals. Everyone who returns with them always seems in better spirits.

      “Whoa, what’s wrong?” asks a scout, hurrying to their side.


      “Felt disoriented there at the end, that’s all.” The pilot shakes their head. “In the cockpit, the earth can be a stranger. I need to feel grounded again.”


      The scout looks around in a wide-eyed, wordless plea for help. He’s met with bewildered shrugs from the rest of the crew. Then his gaze lands on you.

      A rookie pilot, still buzzing from battle, seeks the stunt pilot for advice. You find them at the feet of a recharging mech, the two pilots so small and fragile in comparison.


      “How do you move like that on the battlefield?” the rookie asks, starry-eyed in the lights of the mech bay. “It’s like you’re ice skating or flying or… You’re so smooth!”


      The stunt pilot soaks up the praise, perhaps hungry for it after so long without an audience to witness them. But their advice, when they offer it, is reckless. They catch concerned glances from others in the mech bay who look to you to intervene.

      The stunt pilot hasn’t lost their shine. Tension winds through the crew as the pilot tosses their pistol skyward and launches into an aerial somersault. Despite its bulk, the mech hangs weightlessly at the apex of its arc. Your crew braces for gravity’s part, but the landing is masterful, barely shivering the ground. The sun is in your eyes, and you miss them catch the pistol. Cheers go up. Even several mechanics whoop.


      The stunt pilot instructs the rookie on the simplest part of the trick—the pistol toss. All seems well, but the rookie, overconfident in their first catches, goes for a higher toss. The pistol disappears into the sun. A few meters off, a tree, cleaved in two by a stray shot, comes down—onto the roof of the base.

      The rear bay doors of your mobile base creak open, on the other side is a crowd of Home Guard troops and their respective vehicles. Their uniforms are still clean, but the fresh foliage draped around the vehicles and the cam paint on their faces indicate they’re about to embark on their mission soon.


      “Commander, good to see you.” The officer from earlier shakes your hand, the troops behind her are already unloading the parts from your mobile base, “My thanks for the delivery, sometimes good logistics is all we need to keep the fight going.”


      You say your farewells, the Home Guard departing the drop off point in a hasty but orderly fashion. You wonder if you'll see them again when the war is over.

      “It’s busted, boss.” The glow of the high tech contraption is dimmer, and the whine of electronics is muted. “We can still use it for other parts, but not for what the egg-head had in mind anymore.”

      Not only do you liberate the settlement, but you are able to unload the crates of drugs for the citizens while you're here.


      The Mayor comes over to thank you.


      "We were getting very worried that we wouldn't receive these in time," they tell you, leading you towards the doctor's surgery. "Thank you so much! For this, and for helping rid us of enemy forces. People will be so relieved."


      You accept their thanks, and load back up into the base to carry on your way.

      After liberating the settlement, you expect a celebration, but none comes. When you enquire with the Mayor, they can barely make eye contact with you.


      "When our medication didn't come, we needed to strike a deal with the enemy," they tell you. "Now they're gone, where will we get our prescriptions?"


      You explain that you have crates of medicine for them, and unload them from the base. But people are weary, especially when they find out this was the delivery they were meant to receive weeks ago. It may take time to rebuild trust with these people.

      After the smoke has settled, a townsperson approaches your base. Behind her, you see people stacking crates.


      "You've already done so much for us," she says, "but I have another thing to ask. The government-in-exile tasked us with getting these prescriptions to people in a nearby settlement. But we haven't been able to contact them for a week now. Will you help?"

      A pilot approaches with comms. Apparently there's rumors that a nearby settlement has been making deals with the enemy. They rub their neck nervously before they hand the message over.


      "Apparently the settlement was desperate for medicine and had to make hard decisions. Think this was because of our late delivery?"

      You eye the crates at the back of the base.

      You're looking through the latest report when you hear one of your pilots laughing and calling out to you from the front of the base.


      "Look at this," your pilot says when you join him. "They're sitting ducks."


      Sure enough, on the radar, you can see that there are some enemy mechs up ahead.


      "I think they're gearing up to join the battle over there," He taps the screen where there is a cluster of activity. "We could get in quick, before they know what hit them."

      Someone sniffles softly in the changing room. You catch the sound of it in the gap between your footsteps, and when you pause, you hear voices speaking in low tones.


      “We’re in too deep to quit now -”


      “- don’t want to be just another dead pilot -”


      “- can’t keep going like this -”


      You keep walking. If there is a fight ahead, you will need to be ready.

      All around you, the crew prepare for the fight, and one of your pilots clutches a photograph between gloved fingers.


      “Have to remember the people we’re doing all this for,” murmurs your pilot to you, voice quiet in the din. “The people we’re hoping to come back home to.”


      You only nod, watching as the photo is slipped carefully into a pocket. Somewhere on the base, a mech comes to life.

      You approach the radio tower, and the signal only gets louder on the radio.


      "This is it! This is the spot!" your mechanic says. "Looks like you might have company, though."


      "I guess they really want to make sure they can drip poison in people's ears," one of your pilots sneers. "Come on, boss. Can we take them out? Show them what we think of their lies?"


      "If you take out the mechs, I'll be able to get in there and take the radio off the air," your mechanic tells you. They look eager for the opportunity.

      While your pilots settle down from a battle well-fought, your mechanic goes in to take the radio off the air.


      They return a little while later with a grin on their face.

      Another pilot frowns, leaning in. "Hey, does this dross sound clearer than it usually does? Do you think we might be close to the source? I always thought they must be circuiting the broadcast through a local tower, since there's no way it would reach us otherwise."

      The base approaches a quiet village. Many of the houses have shattered windows and broken doors, and you can see scorch marks from fire.


      You and one of your pilots get out to look around. You eventually come across a group of people who are helping to collect the scattered belongings of one of the villagers.


      One of the women helping with the cleanup points towards the deep tracks left tanks and mechs.


      "We were raided," she says. Her voice is thick. "We tried to look for help, but no one came…"


      You and your pilot give your apologies, and help them gather the last of the villager's items, before you make the long trek back to the base. Once the rest of your team hear what happened, the rest of the day's journey in the base is spent mostly in silence.

      As your renown rises, and people hear of the good your pilots are doing, you start to get more requests from people who would like to join your ranks. Some of them fought in the last war. Others are untested but full of passion after watching the enemy wreck their homes.


      This settlement in particular has pilots clamouring to join you. If resources permit, it may be a good opportunity for you to strengthen your forces.


      Hint: Pilots can be recruited in the mountain base and any settlement that is located in friendly territory.

      The group are carrying crates loaded with scrap metal, a lot of which looks familiar. One of the men looks pleasantly surprised to see you, grinning from ear to ear.


      “Oh, hello, hello! Don’t you mind us. We’re just doing some diggin’ around…it’s good to get in here early, you see, right after you folks have these big fights and leave all your debris around. If we don’t, all of the good scrap is gone fast!” He picks up his crate and waves.


      Your scout frowns. “And where is our scrap [i]going[/i], exactly...?”


      The man’s smile doesn’t move. “Oh, you know…around. To whoever’s got a need.”


      “How trustworthy,” mutters your scout. She turns to you, and asks in a low whisper, “What do you think, boss?”

      Sweat gathers on the technician’s brow, and you catch him sending furtive glances down the hall.


      Some of the civilians on board are getting agitated, he reports. They are opposed to sharing space with an enemy defector and are calling for her removal from the base. The defector herself has been holed up in the armor bay, but has otherwise been ignoring the situation.


      “Her intel is [i]useful[/i], sure…but we don’t want the civilians to leave the base in protest before we can safely transport them to the Guard,” he continues. “What do we do, Commander?”

      Campfire camaraderie settles when you express interest. The pilot continues their story.


      The experimental program was tied to casualties in older units. Pilots who survived the glitch reported that what looked like the most optimal thread led to destruction. Comrades of deceased pilots witnessed them charge into situations the system should’ve averted. A pattern emerged. Those who fought alongside glitched mechs found themselves affected, leading to rumors of a runaway AI.


      Mechs from that era were decommissioned, but it’s unknown what became of them: if they were scrapped for parts, if they’re rusting in a hangar, or if the pressure to not waste time and materials led the engineers to quietly switch out the computers before reinstating the units.


      Your pilots stare up at their mechs.

      You’re poring over the map when you register your pilots’ whispered discussion. One relates a rumor from years past about glitches in the prediction system. Another pilot responds, saying the temporal anomalies remind them of a cursed mech that was decommissioned years ago.


      “The engineers tried to push the boundaries of the prediction system so we could see beyond the immediate future,” the pilot explains. “People say the old code still runs in the background, and sometimes—”


      Your pilots don’t notice you until your shadow falls over them.

      “Commander.”


      As you approach, the leader of the enemy spies stands straighter. He remains calm even with your scout’s weapon trained on him.


      “We know when we’re outgunned,” he says. “So, how about this? Rather than wasting us in some Home Guard cell…we can work for you. We have intel, connections…I’m sure you see the merit.”


      Your scout looks at you. “Bring them on as double agents, huh?”

      At your side, one of your analysts crosses his arms. He grunts.


      “They’ve escaped, it looks like. Damn, I could’ve sworn we had them on the ropes…”


      “On the bright side…at least we chased them out of the area?” your scout interjects. She’s trying to cheer him up.


      “Not much of a bright side if they’re just gonna keep spying somewhere else, kiddo.”


      She sighs. “Right, right…”

      One of your engineers is standing by what remains of the delivery weapon. True to its delicate characteristics, it’s broken into three distinct, derelict chunks. “It’s salvageable, but egg-head from before is gonna be upset.” The engineer tosses one of the parts over his shoulder. “Don’t think too much on it, boss. Contraption probably wasn’t worth the effort.”
