      This game applies mods on startup. We do not recommend the "load mods" option as a way to apply changes, as it can cause unforeseen issues. There is also no support for loading library/code injection mods more than once per session, so any such content will be skipped if the game has already loaded one.


      The "load mods" option is most useful for quickly checking changes while developing config mods. Do you still wish to proceed?
