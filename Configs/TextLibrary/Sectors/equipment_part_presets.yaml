description: Sector containing names and descriptions of part presets (instructions for putting together a part). Since part preset database is a tree where each config can inherit from multiple other configs, this sector can contain names and descriptions associated not just with bottom-most configs in the chain (like Vidar Arm R3), but with higher level configs as well (Vidar or Arm etc.). When a part preset matches multiple pieces of text, they get joined and presented together.
