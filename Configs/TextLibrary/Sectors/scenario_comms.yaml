description: "Communications you receive in combat. Keys ending with \"header\" show who's speaking - normally it's no one unique (you'll find some heavily reused ones at the end, prefixed with \"src\"). Keys ending with \"text\" are main content. Some types of messages have multiple variants - for example, enemy talking about reinforcements would've gotten old too quickly if only one sentence was attached to that event, so there are some variants (\"text_00\", \"text_01\", \"text_02\" etc.).
