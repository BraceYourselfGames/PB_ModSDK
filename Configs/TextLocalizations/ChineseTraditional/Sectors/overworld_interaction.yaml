      在你對海德馬克發動攻擊之後，敵軍尚未重整旗鼓。持續施壓、鎖定容易攻擊的目標，開闢通往山區的道路。在此奪下的領地，將成為盟友與逃離佔領的平民們的避風港。


      戰術地圖上亮起一片敵方信號。你已抵達敵方領地──是時候選定下一個攻擊目標了。
    textEng: >-
      The enemy is still reeling from your attacks in Hedmark. Press the advantage, identify vulnerable targets, and open up a path to the mountains. The ground you gain here will be a safe haven for your allies and civilians fleeing the occupation.


      The tactical map lights up with enemy signatures. You've reached hostile territory; It's time to pick your next target.

      翻越山脈的路徑充滿危險。經過與隊員的短暫討論後，你決定先清除山脊這側的佔領軍。如此一來你就有機會回收更多裝備並累積經驗，再嘗試穿越山道。


      首批敵軍信號出現在地圖上。看來喀斯卡德在這個省份勢力龐大，但經歷前一次戰鬥後，你的駕駛員信心高漲。
    textEng: >-
      The path through the mountain could be perilous. After a short debate with your crew, you decide that the best course of action is to deal with the occupying forces on this side of the ridge. This should give you a chance to salvage extra equipment and gain more experience before attempting the pass.


      The first enemy signatures appear on your map. It looks like Kaskad has a formidable presence in this province, but after the previous battle, your pilots are brimming with confidence.

      你抵達西部山道，一條由山脈切出的長谷。此處是唯一能讓喀斯卡德重型坦克機甲通行的路線，每日都有增援部隊與貴重物資穿越此地。


      攻擊這條命脈將會造成重創。一旦與菲而蘭本土斷絕聯繫，駐守於夕陽之牆這一側的部隊將被迫撤退。山上別無其他出路，奪下這個隘口，即可鞏固你最近的戰果。
    textEng: >-
      You approach the Western Pass, a long valley carved from the surrounding mountain range. It's the only path large enough to accommodate Kaskad's heavy cargo crawlers, which carry reinforcements and valuable supplies through the pass daily.


      Hitting this artery would hurt. Cut off from the rest of Fyrland, the remaining forces this side of the Sunset Walls will be forced to retreat. With no alternate routes through the mountains, taking this chokepoint would seal your recent gains.

      你離開了西部山道。山中通道被切斷，且3F部隊在後方駐守，喀斯卡德幾乎不可能再為外圍省份的前哨補給。


      現在，你將目光轉向東方──菲而蘭的核心地帶。這裡的佔領勢力更加根深蒂固，但憑藉你已獲得的裝備與經驗，駕駛員們比以往更有信心。
    textEng: >-
      You leave the Western Pass behind. With the path through the mountains cut off behind you and the 3F standing guard, it will be nearly impossible for Kaskad to resupply their outposts in the outer provinces.


      Now, you turn your attention east, towards the heart of Fyrland. Here, the occupation is more entrenched — but with the equipment and experience you've already gained, your pilots are feeling more optimistic than ever.

      隊員的士氣高昂。你收到消息，3F部隊的兵力正在持續增加，並在全國各地穩步推進。甚至有傳聞指出首都出現動亂，而喀斯卡德正竭力封鎖你們勝利的消息。


      但你不能因此鬆懈。喀斯卡德顯然正在籌劃重整兵力，企圖奪回已被收復的領土。反抗軍唯有持續施壓，才能阻止他們重新集結。
    textEng: >-
      The crew is in high spirits. You receive word that the 3F has been growing in number and making steady gains across the country. There are even rumours of unrest in the Capital, where Kaskad has been working hard to supress any news of your progress.


      But you can't afford to lose focus. Kaskad has undoubtedly been drawing plans to strengthen their ranks and retake the liberated territories. Only constant pressure from the resistance can prevent that from happening.

    text: 喀斯卡德每撤出一個省份，他們的勢力減弱同時，也讓你們的決心更加堅定。菲而蘭通往自由的道路正逐漸成形，以目前情勢來看，或許你真的能將喀斯卡德徹底逐出這片平原。
    textEng: Every province that Kaskad is forced to withdraw from weakens their position and strengthens your resolve. Fyrland is starting to see the path to freedom, and now it's looking like you might be able to drive Kaskad from the plains for good.

      兩側的山峰沒入低雲之中，前方狹窄蜿蜒的山谷又是一處理想的防禦地形。隨著收復省份的補給線逐漸穩定，反抗軍即使面對龐大的敵方勢力，也有機會在此堅守陣地。


      然而，喀斯卡德也察覺了這個戰略機會。你的掃描儀偵測到前方有一座戒備森嚴的堡壘，內含通訊陣列，而最令人憂心的是──一架未識別的巨獸正在山谷中巡邏。奪下這條山道恐怕得仰賴一點創意。
    textEng: >-
      To your sides, mountain peaks disappear into low clouds. The narrow, winding valley ahead is another ideal defensive position. Thanks to supply lines beginning to run from liberated provinces, the resistance could hold the ground here, even against a massive enemy force.


      But Kaskad has seen the opportunity as well. Ahead, your scanners pick up a stronghold with layered defences, a communications array, and — most worrying — an unidentified Behemoth patrolling the valley. Claiming the pass might take some creativity.

      你掃試周圍疲憊的臉孔。多支喀斯卡德小隊埋伏在隘口外，讓行進變得極度艱難。儘管屢次擊退敵軍，卻使他們兵力更加集中。


      駕駛員設法避開了最危險的區域，而3F部隊仍在後方堅守。然而崎嶇的地形、頭頂盤旋的無人機、以及遠方不斷傳來的砲火聲，令眾人情緒極為緊繃。隨著你們逼近首都，戰火只會愈發激烈。
    textEng: >-
      You glance at the tired faces around you. Multiple Kaskad squads lie in wait outside the pass, making navigation a nightmare. Repeatedly pushing them back has only concentrated their forces.


      Your driver has managed to evade the worst of it, and 3F held the line behind you. But between the rough terrain, drones buzzing overhead, and constant gunfire in the distance, tensions remain high. The battles you face are only going to intensify as you draw closer to the Capital.

    textEng: Victory is almost within reach, but there's still much work to be done. You will need to take out the strongholds in the region to pull forces away from the Capital. With enough pressure, they'll spread themselves too thin and expose a route into the city.

      根據3F部隊的情報，前方這個省份屬於目標豐富的區域。喀斯卡德在佔領初期就已在此盤踞，因此本區聚集大量高階軍官、菁英小隊與具戰略價值的基地。


      雖然任務艱難，但風險值得一搏：若3F部隊能控制此省，即可能打通一條直達首都的路線。
    textEng: >-
      According to 3F intel, the province ahead is a target-rich environment. Kaskad forces entrenched themselves here early in the occupation, resulting in a large number of high-ranking officers, elite squads, and strategically important bases in the region.


      It's going to be a challenge, but the risk will be worth it: if the 3F can take control of the province, it could open up a direct route to the Capital.

      敵軍在全省佈有防禦據點，並預期會遭遇傳統攻擊。想占得上風，你需要對脆弱目標實施精準打擊，並擾亂他們的編隊。


      誘使敵軍四處奔走、留下戰略位置空隙，反抗勢力就能獲得一絲作戰機會。
    textEng: >-
      The enemy has defensive positions all over the province and expects a conventional assault. To gain the upper hand, you will need to make surgical strikes on vulnerable targets and throw their forces into disarray.

      你暫時駐紮在外圍省份。這是一片與國內其他地區隔絕的孤立區域，四周被幾乎難以通行的山脈包圍。


      通往菲而蘭其餘地區的主要通道為西部山道。若能切斷敵方補給線並封鎖此山道，外圍省份便能由反抗軍守住。
    textEng: >-
      You're in the Outer Provinces for now. It is an isolated region cut off from the rest of the country, surrounded by near impassable mountain ranges.


      The main route to the rest of Fyrland is the Western Pass. If you cut the enemy supply lines and manage to block the pass, the Outer Provinces can be held by the resistance forces.

      大家士氣高昂：在這麼短的時間內收復兩個省份，宛如奇蹟。但若無法維持攻勢，這樣的幻象很快就會破滅。敵軍目前鬆懈且反應遲緩，但他們遲早會行動。屆時他們會傾全力鎮壓這場叛亂，若抵抗軍沒有一處易守難攻的隘口，敵人便可能成功。


      你要一路追擊到西部山脈、奪下他們的堡壘，然後看著反擊勢力在城牆前瓦解。這只是時間問題。
    textEng: >-
      Everyone is in high spirits: two provinces liberated in such a short time feels like a miracle. It will prove to be a short-lived mirage if you don't keep up the momentum. The enemy is complacent and slow to react, but they will react. They will bring their full might to crush this rebellion, and they will succeed unless the resistance has an easily defendable chokepoint.


      You'll chase them all the way to the Western Mountains, you'll take their stronghold, and you'll see the counterattack crumble against its walls. It is just a matter of time.

      天色微明。敵人在看似安全的河對岸的城塞度過了驚慌的一夜，準備發動全力攻勢。每條街道都設有路障，橋樑已被封閉，機甲巡邏著市區每一寸土地。


      但你不需要直接攻上城塞，只要取得一條清晰的瞄準線即可。
    textEng: >-
      It's early morning. The enemy has spent a frantic night preparing for an all-out attack on their citadel, seemingly safe on the far side of the river. Every street has been barricaded, bridges have been raised, and mechs patrol every inch of the downtown core.


      But you won't need to get to the citadel; all you need is a clear sightline.

      信號彈划破天空，一道接著一道。幾分鐘內，你開始收到報告：整個城市的喀斯卡德部隊正在解除武裝。當他們的總部化為灰燼後，慌亂的命令請求沒有得到回應。慢慢地，他們開始投降。


      3F部隊動員前往協助傷者，你閉上眼──花費一點時間──讓腎上腺素飆升的感覺歸於平靜。
    textEng: >-
      A flare cuts through the sky, and then another. Within minutes, you start receiving reports: throughout the city, Kaskad forces are standing down. With their headquarters reduced to ash, frantic requests for orders are going unanswered. Slowly, they begin to surrender.


      As the 3F mobilizes to help the injured, you close your eyes and — for a moment — allow your adrenaline to turn to relief.

      基地在翻過小山丘後停了下來，短暫停留幾分鐘掃描周遭。天即將破曉，空氣詭異地平靜。你走下車，眺望眼前的景色。


      首都──從小看慣的景象。即便站在這裡，也能望見市中心那座直聳入雲的龐大建築：那正是喀斯卡德的作戰基地。


      「那東西真難看，對吧？」一名駕駛員說道。「我提議把它毀掉。」
    textEng: >-
      The base comes to a stop as it crests the hill, pausing for a few minutes to scan the surroundings. The sun is about to rise, the air is eerily still. You step outside to take in the view.


      The Capital. A sight you've known since childhood. But even from here, you can see the skyline marred by a massive structure towering over the downtown core: Kaskad's base of operations.


      "That thing's ugly, huh?" says one of your pilots. "I vote we get rid of it."

      敵軍絕不能在這裡失敗。掃描結果顯示：他們已將整座城市要塞化，封鎖所有高速公路，並從全國各地調回精銳小隊。甚至有一艘裝甲護衛艦停泊在城市港口。


      但那仍不足以阻止你。
    textEng: >-
      The enemy can't afford to lose here. The scans come back: they've fortified the city, blocked every highway, and redeployed elite squads from all over the country. There's even a armoured frigate waiting in the city's harbour.

      無線電持續傳來最新狀況。菲而蘭自由軍正在城市周邊部署，準備迎接所有人都盼望已久的最終決戰。


      你非常清楚該做什麼、該去哪裡。這裡是你的家。


      你在地圖上規劃路線時，基地隨即開始行動。

      Inside that citadel is the beating heart of the occupation: the Kaskad officials who were so confident that, in time, you'd accept their subjugation. Who were so sure that they'd come out of this unscathed.


      The radio crackles with constant updates. Fyrland Freedom Forces are deploying along the city's permitter, preparing for what everyone hopes to be the final battle.


      You know exactly what to do and where to go. This is your home.

      工程師們匆忙解釋，3F部隊早已開始拆解被你的小隊擊敗的巨獸。其裝甲被改造為防禦設施，回收的反應爐則用於穩定收復區的能源網。


      然而，那些巨獸的武器大多被報廢──在沒有大型行動載具與龐大電力供應的情況下，被視為不具實際用途。但隨著時間過去，你們坦克機甲的能力已有顯著提升。
    textEng: >-
      The engineers hastily explain that, for some time now, the 3F has been dismantling the Behemoths defeated by your squad. Armour was repurposed as defence measures, salvaged reactors were used to stabilize the power grids of liberated territories.


      However, the weapons were largely scrapped, deemed impractical without a mobile platform and a massive power supply. But over time, the capacity of your crawler has significantly improved.

      你的移動基地已穿越各種地形、克服無數障礙，如今比以往更強大。反應爐的升級幅度甚至讓人推測──或許可以為巨獸的武器供電，即使只能發射一擊也無妨。


      全員立刻開始動工。能讓移動基地擁有與其力量相稱的武裝──例如射程數公里的高能量光束炮──光是想像就讓眾人興奮不已。


      敵軍的城塞矗立在地平線遠方，彷彿在等待著成為靶子。
    textEng: >-
      Your mobile base has navigated through every type of terrain, overcome every obstacle. It's stronger than its ever been. And all the upgrades done to reactor might make it possible to power one of the Behemoth's own weapons, if only for a single shot.


      Your crew gets to work immediately. They're ecstatic at the prospect of giving the mobile base a weapon worthy of its strength — for example, a high-energy beam with a range of a several kilometres.

      堡壘與巨獸同時被摧毀，喀斯卡德部隊迅速撤離山道。他們顯然把那台巨獸視為無法突破的屏障。


      雖然眾人臉上都掛著笑容，但疲憊早已寫在每個人的神情裡。前方，喀斯卡德必定正在重整旗鼓，他們知道你會來。不過3F部隊始終行動更快、戰術更靈活。今晚贏得了片刻喘息，明天，戰火將再度燃起。

    textEng: As you approach the comm station, you get reports of trouble ahead — 3F scouts have scoped out the massive enemy Behemoth patrolling the valley, and it appears to be armed with a new type of advanced shielding.

      菲而蘭自由軍回報，他們成功偽造了巨獸的導航訊號，讓它全速朝敵軍堡壘衝去。喀斯卡德單位正緊急調派兵力攔截，但要徹底阻止它幾乎不可能。


      這架全自動巨獸仍然構成威脅，但接下來的撞擊應該會對它與基地同時造成嚴重損害，讓奪回山道的計劃變得確實可行。

      Fyrland Freedom Forces report that they've successfully spoofed the Behemoth's navigation signal and sent it barrelling towards the enemy stronghold. Kaskad units are scrambling to intercept it, but stopping it completely will be nearly impossible.

      恭喜你，指揮官。這是一場艱苦的戰役，但你成功逼退壓迫者，令其撤出首都。多年來第一次，菲而蘭終於能重新掌握自己的命運。


      你與隊伍理應獲得一段長時間的休息。但若你想繼續參戰，仍有任務待完成。即便首都已收復，仍有省份頑強抵抗，試圖阻擋3F部隊的攻勢，並抱持喀斯卡德能逆轉局勢的希望。現在正是徹底擊退其殘餘兵力的時刻。

      Congratulations, Commander. It's been a difficult battle, but you've successfully forced our oppressors to withdraw from the Capital. For the first time in years, Fyrland can be in control of its own destiny.


      You and your team have deserved a long rest. But if and when you'd like to continue your campaign, there’s still work to be done. Even with the Capital liberated, there are provinces where the occupation stubbornly persists, attempting to hold the line against the 3F and clinging to the hope that Kaskad will somehow turn things around. It's time to drive their remaining forces back for good.

      一名又一名駕駛員，將頭盔掛在他們滿是傷痕的機甲旁。多年來第一次，大家開始談起回家的計畫──想見的家人與朋友，想為失去的人留下的思念。這片刻的現實，反而顯得有些不真實。戰爭結束了，菲而蘭重獲自由。


      理所當然地，你將移動基地送回朗塞特進行必要的維修，然後離開它，踏上漫長的歸途。

      She nods towards the person at her side. "We even have a pilot with us, but since you're the ones with the actual mechs, maybe they want to stick with you instead?"

      A while later, they return to the mobile base with some grease on their hands and a smile on their face. "Got a little more hands-on than expected, but they should be chasing ghosts for the next few days."

      你眺望眼前那片廣闊的土地──儘管遭佔領多年，這裡仍讓你感到熟悉如故。


      一名駕駛員指向你正前方地圖上的一個地點：朗塞特──菲而蘭北境的一座偏遠前哨，如今已落入喀斯卡德掌控。如果情報可信的話，這裡有一座正在維修中的移動基地。


      是時候採取行動了。
    textEng: >-
      You peer out at the vast stretch of land before you — despite years of occupation, it still feels like home.


      A pilot points to a spot on the map directly ahead of you: Langset, one of Fyrland's remote outposts, now under Kaskad's command. And, if your intel can be trusted, home to a mobile base currently undergoing repair.


      It's time to make your move.

      Your mech frames haven't had a tune-up since before the invasion, but they should have no trouble here. Especially when they're equipped with prediction systems.

The resulting bombardment caused the Late Devonian extinction and rendered the surface inhospitable for thousands of years. Our shores and mountains still bear the scars, carved by ancient craters.'

    text: 月球消逝時，留下了一份餞別禮給我們。到了1940年代，在世界各地的撞擊坑中發現了豐富的氦3與稀土金屬礦藏。短短三十年間，近於無限的同位素資源供應，為核融合技術鋪平了道路，也讓能源匱乏成為歷史名詞。然而，原子時代卻就此夭折。
    textEng: The moon left us a parting gift. By the 1940s, rich deposits of Helium 3 and rare earth metals were discovered at the impact sites around world. In just three decades, virtually limitless supply of suitable isotopes paved the way for nuclear fusion and made energy scarcity a thing of the past. The Atomic Age was cut short.

    text: 和平與繁榮並未持續太久。武器開發、機動裝甲製造，以及進入星際軌道的嘗試，消耗了龐大的同位素資源。到了1980年代，許多軍事化國家幾乎耗盡了儲備。他們不願改變方向，於是將目光轉向國界之外。
    textEng: Peace and prosperity didn't last much longer. Weapons development, mobile armor manufacturing and attempts to break into orbit consumed vast quantities of isotopes. By the 1980s, many militarized nations nearly depleted their reserves. Unwilling to change, they looked beyond their borders.

    text: 菲而蘭的地貌本身即代表地底蘊藏著財富──滿布坑洞的山谷、坐落在古老隕石坑中的湖泊，以及被礦脈染色的山巒。當政府開始將地質調查結果列為機密時，我們的家園早已成為他國覬覦的目標。遭受入侵只是遲早的事。
    textEng: 'The very landscape of Fyrland hints at the riches under the surface: pockmarked valleys, lakes nestled in ancient craters, mountains stained by mineral veins. By the time geological surveys were classified, our home was already in the crosshairs. The invasion was all but inevitable.'

      對邊界瀑布的攻擊，是一連串戰火的開端。


      毫無預警、也沒有任何預先挑釁，喀斯卡德自治領迅速入侵鄰國──菲而蘭共和國。那場吞併既殘酷，又徹底。
    textEng: >-
      The attack on Boundary Falls was the first of many.


      Without warning or provocation, the Kaskad Dominion swiftly overran their neighbouring country, the Republic of Fyrland. The annexation was brutal and absolute.

      短短數日內，菲而蘭的軍隊便化為廢鐵與殘骸。


      倖存者逃往各處，尋找僅存的安全角落。他們以回收或重組的裝備武裝自己，共同組成一支反抗軍，展開對佔領者的秘密行動與游擊戰。


      隨著時間過去，這支部隊被稱為「菲而蘭自由軍」，或簡稱3F部隊。
    textEng: >-
      Within days, Fyrland's military was reduced to scrap and rubble.


      Their surviving forces fled to whatever safe corners they could find. Armed only with salvaged or rebuilt equipment, they worked together to form a resistance, engaging in covert and guerrilla warfare against their occupiers.


      Over time, they became known as the "Fyrland Freedom Forces", or the "3F".

      人數日漸減少，他們的勝利也難以持久。但3F部隊擁有喀斯卡德所沒有的一樣東西：從邊界瀑布戰役中搶救出來的「預測技術」原型。


      這些原型被託付給少數幾名機甲駕駛員，他們能以近乎超自然的準確度與速度，精準打擊壓迫者。
    textEng: >-
      With dwindling numbers, their victories were short-lived. But the 3F had one thing that Kaskad didn't: the prototype prediction technology that had been saved from Boundary Falls.


      These prototypes were entrusted to a small group of mech pilots, who could use it to strike at their oppressors with seemingly supernatural precision and speed.

      要冒著風險使用這項唯一的優勢，時機必須萬無一失。過去三年，他們潛伏於暗處，等待那個反攻的契機。


      而那個時刻──就是今天。

      To risk their one advantage, the time had to be right. For the last three years, they have remained hidden, waiting for their opportunity to fight back.


      That opportunity is today.

      最後一座堡壘陷落在即，敵軍全面撤退。菲而蘭自由軍開始架設防線，並將從此接管這個省份。附近城鎮陸續傳來慶祝的消息。


      雖然仍有許多任務在前方等著你們，但那都可以之後再說。隊員們顯得心情激昂，期待著好好享受一次他們應得的休息。附近的反抗軍前哨應該是個不錯的落腳點。

      With the last stronghold falling, the enemy is in full retreat. Fyrland Freedom Forces are setting up defenses and will hold the province from here on out. Reports of celebrations in nearby towns are coming in.


      There is still much to be done, but that can come later. Your crew is in good spirits and is looking forward to a well deserved rest. A resistance outpost nearby should be a good place to stop.
