    Experimental 2017.3 build with multiple fixes to issues discovered in recent builds and progress on core systems.

  changesSmall:
  - Progress on interruption implementation and fundamental order/AI systems. Major revisions to tactical battle controller to support new turn flow and interruptions.
  - AI is now able to reason about and select reactionary orders as part of turn flow.

  - Streamlined battle controller code, simplified turn flow sequencing, added support for unit resources given at each turn on internal combat tich or once per battle.
  - Added some interruption specific orders.
  - Until interruption implementation is finished, it's disabled by default with a parameter in tweakables.yaml config.
  - Began adding testing code for forward deployment resource to test new resource system capabilities.

    This release contains several hotfixes to issues discovered in 0.5 and first optimization pass for environments (resulting on 2x performance boost on some configurations)

  changesMedium:
  - Significant optimization pass on the environment shaders - more materials utilize GPU instancing, all scaling is moved to GPU to prevent breakage of instancing batches (known issue - objects can disappear too early when crossing the edge of the frame), optimized fragment operations
  - Fixed pathfinding graph generation for  combat scenarios launched after other scenarios featuring scenes of same size
  - Improved the damage visualization on mechs - weapons and pods no longer show see-through holes in a critically damaged state, overall damage is less pronounced on lower levels, certain parts like weapons, heads and shoulder armor fall out when destroyed instead of staying on the mech or disappearing
  - Implemented prop tinting similar to tilset object tinting utilized in the buildings, to be used in environment design later on

  changesSmall:
  - Fixed stat tracking to use pilot IDs instead of mech IDs, since enemy faction frequently uses duplicate unit blueprints
  - Weapons can't be destroyed before arm armor parts now, making it harder to make a unit useless in combat with one lucky shot
  - Improved road decal shader (it no longer casts shadows)

    Closed test build focused on content updates, continued development of the stat system and fixing several issues discovered on 0.5.

  changesMedium:
  - Improved unit stat tracking and started implementation of new mission debriefing, featuring XP gains for units, per-unit stats and other info that would be tied into the campaign system
  - Basic implementation of death variants - units can shut down now, letting go of the weapons and dropping instead of exploding
  - Reduced allocations in heavily utilized methods of level system classes, slightly improving level update and loading performance and memory use
  - Massive number of new civilian props created (though not yet used on the levels) - phone booths, benches, abandoned travel bags and other personal belongings, trash cans and containers and other important assets allowing for environment storytelling and building appropriate atmosphere
  - New location meant for testing environment assets for countryside missions (filled small wooden homes, fences, gardens and so on)

  changesSmall:
  - Implemented the damage multiplier setting allowing a user to scale weapon damage in the game in 1x-4x range (for collecting feedback on better TTK and average damage per turn)
  - Re-enabled breaking away from targeted camera mode on enemy turns, disabled automated camera rig
  - Fixed several props on the resistance base being affected by gravity
  - Certain items are now torn off from the mech on destruction (weapons, arm armor, heads)
  - Arm armor and weapons are no longer erroneously hidden on destruction
  - Fixed music parameter value ranges used by combat music manager
  - Fixed a minor error in UI and combat controller flow leading to error spam on each turn
  - Fixes to multiblock implementation opening the path to multiblocks on non-default tilesets; added proof of concept multiblock elements for rural tileset (large roof sections)
  - Fixes to prop shaders incorrectly rendering the smoothness output
  - Fixes to prop system incorrectly handling rendering of falling destructible objects
  - Enabled GPU instancing on props which were not previously using it
  - Updated background panoramas to remove some edge seams

    Closed test build focused on updates to pathfinding system, camera system, input system and music system - and a lot of smaller improvements.

  changesLarge:
  - Pathfinding system reworked - units correctly claim nodes, AI can't walk into occupied spaces, general pathfinding performance improved
  - Pathfinding graph generation reworked - improved performance, generation of multiple link types (climbs, drops, vaults and so on), on-demand regeneration support
  - Pathfinding graph is now regenerated after every destruction event, allowing units to carve walkable tunnels through the buildings, walk through space left by demolished floors and so on
  - Reworked music system code and new audio mix - music fades out on periods of inactivity, responds to different events and balance on the battlefield, all transitions and states improved.
  - Implemented new camera system - complex rig consisting of three orbiting cameras, vertical control of look target, fast target switching, improved cursor, improved enemy tracking and so on. Still a work in progress meant to be tweaked and extended.


  changesMedium:
  - Units can move over new link types - climbing onto roofs, vaulting over low obstacles, hopping over narrow ravines and so on. Fair warning - no custom animations used yet, so jumps and turns can look goofy.
  - Link types can influence movement trajectories now, allowing units not to sink into walls mid-movement to node at different height
  - Implemented new help screen meant to aid players learning controls and UI. Can be accessed from the pause menu, from F1 on keyboard and from menu button on the gamepad. When accessed through a shortcut, displays input hints about the currently used input device. Automatically opened for players launching their first combat session.
  - Fixed decelerating parts of falling structures abruptly disappearing, improved physics simulation of falling structures (unbalanced load introduces spin), improved performance by starting structural analysis only on destruction of points directly influencing the graph

  changesSmall:
  - Aiming IK on units updated to allow them to target points at high up and far below
  - Weapons shift in direction of each shot during firing, making high scattering angles less jarring to observe
  - Added a small disclaimer to the intro sequence meant to set expectations for new players (along the lines of Discord FAQ)
  - Gamepad users can now jump to different plane - hold right stick to preview destination, let go to jump up
  - New editable configs for music system and input system added to Configs/Systems
  - New input settings added to main menu, allowing you to configure rotation sensitivity and vertical inversion on mouse and gamepad
  - Reworked combat session stat tracking (currently used by music system - mission completion UI not updated yet)
  - Fixes to prop destruction not working correctly on destruction of surrounding environment, fixed tree shaders not supporting fade-on-destruction effect
  - Updates to resistance base set dressing and squad door animations
  - Fixes to path visualization in combat (improved height difference handling, better smoothing, reduced allocations)
  - Improved test environments, added experimental sixth environment (fuel plant)
  - Fixes to multi-type props not being randomly selected (mech debris, building debris), added new prop left by destroyed structures
  - Fixed incorrect mission previews and intro camera positions on certain scenarios
  - Improved spawn performance and consistency of debris piles left by small props
  - Lots of small changes and fixes to prop/environment art
  - Improved environment destruction effects (fire is a chained effect that starts with flammable material being ignited and burns out over time) and mech destruction effects

    This release brings another set of hotfixes and some minor visual improvements. All changes introduced in 0.4 cycle are still revelant for testing.

  changesMedium:
  - Implemented a shortcut to weapon hardpoints in the top level unit information screen, decouple area definitions from UI hardpoint groups for easier future extension of unit customization UI
  - Implemented a temporary workaround to broken temporal AA on certain shaders, allowing use of temporal AA without screen corruption
  - Improved design consistency between UI screens, made every screen use exact same style of background blur, fix issues with certain panels not applying dimming to improve readability of text on bright backgrounds
  - Improved unit loadout warnings - UI should warn about missing weapons, missing armor, and missing critical internals separately
  - Updated the unit used in the resistance base to allow customization to be applied to the frame (move to skinned mesh renderer consistent with combat version of the mech), improved the default pose
  - Implemented basic animations posing the mechs on resistance base to prevent long weapons from going into the ground and to make two-handed weapons correctly gripped when left weapon slot is not occupied
  - Improvements to the squad scene - fixes to the door animation not playing in build, better unit positions, new sound effects, spaced out events for better impact, tweaked particle system providing fog, tweaked light intensities

  changesSmall:
  - Implemented attachments for falling destructible props, added soil decals and soil clump/root models for falling trees
  - Improved animated falling tree logic for more consistent fall directions (prop type used on smaller trees)
  - Fixed unsafe handling of loadouts with missing left weapon in the order details UI
  - Fixed order list background not being resized on weapon switch and other order list changes
  - Fixed left weapon slot incorrectly permitting use of two-handed weapons
  - Fixed integrity calculation in unit information screen on the resistance base - HP readouts on body area entries shouldn't include empty hardpoints
  - Fixed HBAO detail pass settings (disabled deinterlacing was leading to pixelated appearance on high-performance quality preset)
  - Fixed the hover zone of unit widgets being too small in gamepad input mode
  - Fixed the squad scene mechs not being updated after changes were made to them in the hangar scene
  - Fixed the incorrectly positioned and rendered shadow in the white customization scene
  - Fixed low pool size for movement markers making certain positions unclickable on levels with large open surfaces
  - Implemented basic hideable quads used to provide correct backdrop for blur in areas with fullscreen UI coverage (intro, map, briefing)

    Closed test build focused on updates to postprocessing stack and UI as well as some pending small bugfixes. All changes introduced in 0.4 cycle are still revelant for testing.

  changesLarge:
  - Move to new postprocessing stack and updated version of HBAO, implement changes to settings and posteffect classes required to support new features
  - Implement new UI blur effect using one unified render target, performant separable blur and stencil masking on of individual UI elements and drop use of grabpasses to improve UI performance and improve UI readability
  - Implement basic inspection mechanic (detailed info about units revealed on hover)
  - Implement separate special FX for armor hits, internal hits, overpenetrating hits, internally shattering hits and area of effect hits.

  changesMedium:
  - Implement new sound effects for hits to mechs corresponding to damage distribution (hits to armor should sound differently from penetrating hits to internals)
  - Move to integrated deinterleaved version of HBAO to improve performance and quality of secondary AO passes
  - Fix color bleeding sampling of HBAO to prevent emissive objects from contributing to it (fix pseudo-bloom around bright objects)

  changesSmall:
  - Fix incorrect average and potential damage calculation in weapon widget during combat (caused by duplicated shot-per-attack and fragment-per-shot multiplication)
  - Fix cursor position checks not being implemented in hardpoint and customization screens, resulting in scrolling triggering list scrolling and camera zooming.
  - Fix weapon icons being dependent on right slot item, not currently selected weapon
  - Fix the palette widget not appearing on entry to customization screen
  - Disable leg jittering on ejected mechs
  - Make circular line objects reused to reduce load from constant range redraws
  - Improve range redraws to only show minimum, minimum optimal, maximum optimal and maximum range, not 8 nondescript circles in between min and max range
  - Improve the design of damage report widget, make certain elements of unit info widget rendered over blurred background to improve readability

    Closed test build incorporating some error fixes and input improvements. All changes from 0.4p3 are still relevant and in need of testing, of course. 

  changesLarge:
  - Targeted orders now have two step flow where first step is target selection with free cursor and second step is target confirmation with locked cursor. This allows gamepad users to confirm orders without the need to keep targets in screen center and makes order validation flow more obvious to players.

  changesMedium:
  - Prevented scroll wheel from affecting the cameras when cursor hovers over UI list view and prevented it from affecting UI views when cursor hovers over main camera output
  - Implemented "repair all units", "repair unit", "repair hardpoint" options, allowed navigation in damaged areas

  changesSmall:
  - Disable effect from inputs on combat camera when pause menu is entered
  - Fixed mechs no longer having full integrity from the get go due to new per-hardpoint scalars making persisted HP values differ from new max values
  - Improved and accelerated repair FX
  - Gamepad input hints corrected, now hidden by default

  - Fixed AI firing at empty/ejected units
  - Fixed AI changing positions back and forth (shuffling)
  - Reaction dialog no longer triggers multiple times per turn from multiple units at once
  - Environment block integrity now visualized with an overlay depicting cracks and dents
  - Indestructible cells in the environment can be visually damaged now
  - Move order paths now recalculated as user moves cursor around, not on click
  - Pilot look behavior in pods improved

  changesSmall:
  - Dialog skipping (known to cause issues with game logic blocking) is now disabled by default and can be turned on in gameplay settings
  - Dialog animations play out faster
  - Fixed material property blocks not being applied to torn off arm meshes
  - Implemented new tanker truck props

    PAX build, mostly focused on getting visually polished experience for short gamepad-based demoing. Unstable over multiple combat sessions.

  changesLarge:
  - Pilots and units for enemy faction are now randomly selected on each scenario
  - Pilot visuals improved (helmets, armor, lighting, face customizations and so on)
  - Intro sequence implemented in missions
  - Basic proof-of-concept dialog implemented in missions (start, first engagement, second attack covered by it)
  - Targeting indicator added for AoE attacks.
  - Orders are now sorted by priority
  - Input hints improved across whole game (better texts, collapsing of similar hints into a single line with fading between variants, better positioning, semitransparency with blurred background)

  changesMedium:
  - Lots of other minor stuff and backend fixes I definitely forgot about
  - Multiple new sound effects implemented
  - Transition to combat music correctly happens in the intro sequence now
  - Order list now shows which orders are enabled by graying them out
  - If just-executed order is now disabled for whatever reason (no reload because clip is now full, no attack because clip is now empty, or simply no AP remaining, and so on), the game will attempt to find another still-enabled appropriate order. Depleting a weapon would instantly bring you to reload order and vice versa.
  - Switching weapons now triggers a search for equivalent orders and brings your selection to them, allowing you to stay on Fire or Reload orders when you switch the weapon.
  - Fancy shadow visualization added to show sightlines. Displayed from the player position or from missile launcher attack position.
  - Death animations added.
  - Orders requiring exact same amount of AP as remaining can now be confirmed
  - Duplicated enemies no longer appear in missions
  - Gamepad controls are no longer inverted in horizontal menus on the base
  - Mouse cursor now hidden when gamepad is active
  - Standby order confirmation now works with controller

  changesSmall:
  - New music track implemented
  - Control scheme improved, D-Pad no longer used for anything but selecting orders with left/right inputs.
  - Weapon switching is now mapped to X on gamepad, MMB on mouse and Tab on keyboard. Mouse is now capable of tabbing through targets like shoulder buttons on gamepad allow you to do (with side forward/back mouse buttons 4 and 5). Y confirms orders as is, A is contextual attempt to select target from cursor position or confirm order if it's the same.
  - Order information widget now fades out confirmation button on disabled orders
  - Improved missile launcher visuals
  - Prop destruction visuals improved
  - Truck prop is now destructible
  - Pilot quips about damage in combat no longer arrive from wrong units
  - It is no longer possible to select units from your own faction when tabbing in attack orders
  - Street lights no longer disappear on destruction
  - Levels improved in several places (more props, better cover)
