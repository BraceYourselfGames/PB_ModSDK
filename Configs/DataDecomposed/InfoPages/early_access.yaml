  We’re excited for you to experience Phantom Brigade and to have your help shaping its development during its Early Access period.


  During the course of development, some aspects of the game might feel rough, sparse, or buggy. Every month, we’ll release a major update which will include bug fixes, new features and “quality of life” improvements for players. We appreciate your patience and feedback throughout this process, as we work to deliver the most important features and fixes.


  From the Main Menu, check out our Early Access Roadmap to see what’s coming next for Phantom Brigade, reach out to us via the Brace Yourself Games Discord community, or read the latest Patch Notes for the latest changes and known issues.


  Thank you for joining us on this journey, and we look forward to making Phantom Brigade better and better with your help!
