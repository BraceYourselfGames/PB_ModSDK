    comment: Add hardpoint for rarity modifications and perks. Before adding, check if generated part rating is 1 or higher. This requirement matches between these two hardpoints, so we might as well do it in one pass. Order set to 10 to ensure initial setup on child presets is done first (e.g. main internal)
