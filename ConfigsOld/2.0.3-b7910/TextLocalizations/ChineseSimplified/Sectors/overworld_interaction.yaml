      敌军还没有从海德马克的突袭中缓过神来。赶紧乘胜追击，锁定薄弱目标，开辟通向群山的通道。你们在此处夺取的阵地，将成为逃离占领区的盟友与平民的庇护所。


      敌方信号在战术地图上亮起，你们已进入敌占区，是时候选定下一个目标了。
    textEng: >-
      The enemy is still reeling from your attacks in Hedmark. Press the advantage, identify vulnerable targets, and open up a path to the mountains. The ground you gain here will be a safe haven for your allies and civilians fleeing the occupation.


      The tactical map lights up with enemy signatures. You've reached hostile territory; It's time to pick your next target.

      翻越山脉危机四伏。和机组人员简短商议后，你决定先清理山脊这一侧的占领军。这样既有机会回收更多装备，也能在尝试翻越山口前积累实战经验。


      战术地图上出现了首批敌方信号。看来卡斯卡德在该省兵力不弱，但在上一仗之后，所有驾驶员都信心十足。
    textEng: >-
      The path through the mountain could be perilous. After a short debate with your crew, you decide that the best course of action is to deal with the occupying forces on this side of the ridge. This should give you a chance to salvage extra equipment and gain more experience before attempting the pass.


      The first enemy signatures appear on your map. It looks like Kaskad has a formidable presence in this province, but after the previous battle, your pilots are brimming with confidence.

      你已接近西部山口。这条由周围山脉自然形成的悠长峡谷，是唯一能容纳卡斯卡德重型运输车队的通道，每天都有载着增援与珍贵补给的爬行者从此经过。


      若能切断这条要道，必将重创敌军。届时被困在落日壁垒这一侧的残余部队，将彻底失去与费尔兰后方的联系，不得不后撤。群山中再无其他通路，只要拿下这块咽喉之地，便能守住你近期夺回的阵地。
    textEng: >-
      You approach the Western Pass, a long valley carved from the surrounding mountain range. It's the only path large enough to accommodate Kaskad's heavy cargo crawlers, which carry reinforcements and valuable supplies through the pass daily.


      Hitting this artery would hurt. Cut off from the rest of Fyrland, the remaining forces this side of the Sunset Walls will be forced to retreat. With no alternate routes through the mountains, taking this chokepoint would seal your recent gains.

      你离开了西部山口。后方的山路已被切断，并有费尔兰自由军的部队驻守，卡斯卡德几乎无法再向外省的前哨提供补给。


      现在，你将注意力转向东面，直指费尔兰的中心。这里的占领军势力更为根深蒂固——但凭借你们已经获得的装备和积累的经验，驾驶员们正斗志昂扬，士气空前高涨。
    textEng: >-
      You leave the Western Pass behind. With the path through the mountains cut off behind you and the 3F standing guard, it will be nearly impossible for Kaskad to resupply their outposts in the outer provinces.


      Now, you turn your attention east, towards the heart of Fyrland. Here, the occupation is more entrenched — but with the equipment and experience you've already gained, your pilots are feeling more optimistic than ever.

      机组人员士气高涨。你收到消息：费尔兰自由军的规模正在壮大，并在全国范围内稳步获取胜利。甚至有传言称首都局势动荡不安，卡斯卡德正竭力封锁你们取得进展的消息。


      但你们决不能松懈。卡斯卡德无疑正在制定反扑计划，试图重整军力并夺回被解放的领地。抵抗军必须持续施压，才能阻止他们的计划得逞。
    textEng: >-
      The crew is in high spirits. You receive word that the 3F has been growing in number and making steady gains across the country. There are even rumours of unrest in the Capital, where Kaskad has been working hard to supress any news of your progress.


      But you can't afford to lose focus. Kaskad has undoubtedly been drawing plans to strengthen their ranks and retake the liberated territories. Only constant pressure from the resistance can prevent that from happening.

    text: 每夺回一省，卡斯卡德的势力便被削弱一分，而你们的决心也会随之增强。费尔兰已经看得到自由的曙光，而现在看来，你们或许真的能将卡斯卡德彻底驱逐出这片平原。
    textEng: Every province that Kaskad is forced to withdraw from weakens their position and strengthens your resolve. Fyrland is starting to see the path to freedom, and now it's looking like you might be able to drive Kaskad from the plains for good.

      两侧的山峰高耸入云，前方蜿蜒狭窄的山谷，也是一处理想的防御阵地。得益于已解放省份建立的补给线，抵抗军即便面对大军压境，也足以在此地站稳脚跟。


      但卡斯卡德也察觉到了这个机会。扫描仪在前方发现了一座设有多层防御和通信阵列的据点，而最令人不安的是，有一台身份不明的巨兽正在山谷中巡逻。想要夺取山口，恐怕要多动点脑筋了。
    textEng: >-
      To your sides, mountain peaks disappear into low clouds. The narrow, winding valley ahead is another ideal defensive position. Thanks to supply lines beginning to run from liberated provinces, the resistance could hold the ground here, even against a massive enemy force.


      But Kaskad has seen the opportunity as well. Ahead, your scanners pick up a stronghold with layered defences, a communications array, and — most worrying — an unidentified Behemoth patrolling the valley. Claiming the pass might take some creativity.

    text: >-
      你瞥见周围疲惫的面孔。多支卡斯卡德小队潜伏在山口之外，令行进路线险象环生。一次次将他们击退，反而让他们更加集结。


      驾驶员已竭力避开最凶险的交火区，费尔兰自由军也在后方坚守住了防线。但崎岖的地形、头顶嗡嗡作响的无人机和远方不绝于耳的枪声都在让紧张气氛持续弥漫。你们越接近首都，面临的战斗只会越发激烈。
    textEng: >-
      You glance at the tired faces around you. Multiple Kaskad squads lie in wait outside the pass, making navigation a nightmare. Repeatedly pushing them back has only concentrated their forces.


      Your driver has managed to evade the worst of it, and 3F held the line behind you. But between the rough terrain, drones buzzing overhead, and constant gunfire in the distance, tensions remain high. The battles you face are only going to intensify as you draw closer to the Capital.

    textEng: Victory is almost within reach, but there's still much work to be done. You will need to take out the strongholds in the region to pull forces away from the Capital. With enough pressure, they'll spread themselves too thin and expose a route into the city.

      根据费尔兰自由军的情报，前方省份目标众多。卡斯卡德在占领初期便在那里重兵布防，因而该地区聚集了大量高级军官、精英小队和战略要地。


      这必将是一场恶战，但值得冒险：如果费尔兰自由军能夺下该省，便能开辟一条直通首都的路线。
    textEng: >-
      According to 3F intel, the province ahead is a target-rich environment. Kaskad forces entrenched themselves here early in the occupation, resulting in a large number of high-ranking officers, elite squads, and strategically important bases in the region.


      It's going to be a challenge, but the risk will be worth it: if the 3F can take control of the province, it could open up a direct route to the Capital.

      敌军正在全省范围严阵以待，准备应对常规进攻。为夺取优势，你必须对薄弱目标实施精确打击，彻底打乱敌方部署。


      诱使敌人东奔西走，并放弃部分战略据点，为抵抗军争取到可战之机。
    textEng: >-
      The enemy has defensive positions all over the province and expects a conventional assault. To gain the upper hand, you will need to make surgical strikes on vulnerable targets and throw their forces into disarray.

      你目前所在的外省区是一个与全国其他地区隔绝的孤立地区，周围被几乎无法通行的山脉环绕。


      通往费尔兰其余地区的主要通道是西部山口。只要切断敌军补给线并成功封锁山口，抵抗军就能牢牢守住外省区。
    textEng: >-
      You're in the Outer Provinces for now. It is an isolated region cut off from the rest of the country, surrounded by near impassable mountain ranges.


      The main route to the rest of Fyrland is the Western Pass. If you cut the enemy supply lines and manage to block the pass, the Outer Provinces can be held by the resistance forces.

      全军士气高昂：你们在短时间内解放两省，堪称奇迹。但若不能乘胜追击，这胜利很快就会化为泡影。敌军虽骄惰迟钝，但终将作出反应。他们必会倾尽全力镇压叛乱，除非抵抗军能握有一处易守难攻的咽喉要地，否则必将功败垂成。


      你会一路追到西部山脉，攻下敌军据点，见证他们的反攻在城墙之下土崩瓦解。这只是时间问题。
    textEng: >-
      Everyone is in high spirits: two provinces liberated in such a short time feels like a miracle. It will prove to be a short-lived mirage if you don't keep up the momentum. The enemy is complacent and slow to react, but they will react. They will bring their full might to crush this rebellion, and they will succeed unless the resistance has an easily defendable chokepoint.


      You'll chase them all the way to the Western Mountains, you'll take their stronghold, and you'll see the counterattack crumble against its walls. It is just a matter of time.

      破晓时分，敌人彻夜未眠，疯狂加固河对岸那座看似固若金汤的堡垒：每条街道都设了路障，所有吊桥尽数升起，机甲巡逻队一寸不漏地巡守着市中心。


      但你无需强攻堡垒，你只需要获得一道清晰的射击视线。
    textEng: >-
      It's early morning. The enemy has spent a frantic night preparing for an all-out attack on their citadel, seemingly safe on the far side of the river. Every street has been barricaded, bridges have been raised, and mechs patrol every inch of the downtown core.


      But you won't need to get to the citadel; all you need is a clear sightline.

      信号弹接连划破天际。几分钟内，战报频传：卡斯卡德部队在全城范围内停止抵抗。随着他们的总部化为灰烬，疯狂传来的求援讯号无人应答。敌军开始陆续缴械投降。


      在费尔兰自由军动员救治伤员时，你闭上了眼睛，让你的肾上腺素暂时放松下来。
    textEng: >-
      A flare cuts through the sky, and then another. Within minutes, you start receiving reports: throughout the city, Kaskad forces are standing down. With their headquarters reduced to ash, frantic requests for orders are going unanswered. Slowly, they begin to surrender.


      As the 3F mobilizes to help the injured, you close your eyes and — for a moment — allow your adrenaline to turn to relief.

      基地在翻过山顶后停下，停顿数分钟以扫描周围环境。太阳即将升起，空气出奇地寂静。你走出车外，眺望眼前的景色。


      首都——那是你从小就熟悉的地方。但即便从这里，你也能看到天际线被一座高耸于市中心核心区的巨型建筑所破坏——那就是卡斯卡德的行动基地。


      “那玩意儿真难看，是吧？”一名驾驶员说道，“我支持把它铲平。”

      The base comes to a stop as it crests the hill, pausing for a few minutes to scan the surroundings. The sun is about to rise, the air is eerily still. You step outside to take in the view.


      The Capital. A sight you've known since childhood. But even from here, you can see the skyline marred by a massive structure towering over the downtown core: Kaskad's base of operations.


      "That thing's ugly, huh?" says one of your pilots. "I vote we get rid of it."

      敌人绝不能在此地失利。扫描结果显示：他们已加固城防，封锁了所有高速公路，并从全国调回了精英小队。甚至还有一艘装甲护卫舰正停在城市港口待命。


      但这些仍不足以阻挡你。
    textEng: >-
      The enemy can't afford to lose here. The scans come back: they've fortified the city, blocked every highway, and redeployed elite squads from all over the country. There's even a armoured frigate waiting in the city's harbour.

      无线电不断传来嘶哑的战情通报。费尔兰自由军正在城市外围部署兵力，为这场众人期盼的最终决战做准备。


      你很清楚自己要做什么，要去什么地方。这里是你的家园。


      你在地图上标定路线的同时，基地也随之运转了起来。

      Inside that citadel is the beating heart of the occupation: the Kaskad officials who were so confident that, in time, you'd accept their subjugation. Who were so sure that they'd come out of this unscathed.


      The radio crackles with constant updates. Fyrland Freedom Forces are deploying along the city's permitter, preparing for what everyone hopes to be the final battle.

      工程师们匆忙解释道，这段时间以来，自由军一直在拆解被你们小队击败的巨兽机甲。其装甲被改造成了防御工事，回收的反应堆则被用于稳定解放领土上的能源网络。


      然而，由于缺乏移动平台和巨型供能系统，这些武器大多被判定为不实用而遭到了拆解。但随着时间的推移，你的爬行者承载能力早已显著提升。
    textEng: >-
      The engineers hastily explain that, for some time now, the 3F has been dismantling the Behemoths defeated by your squad. Armour was repurposed as defence measures, salvaged reactors were used to stabilize the power grids of liberated territories.


      However, the weapons were largely scrapped, deemed impractical without a mobile platform and a massive power supply. But over time, the capacity of your crawler has significantly improved.

      你的移动基地跋涉过各类地形，克服了无数障碍。它比以往任何时候都更坚固。而所有对反应堆的升级改造，或许足以驱动一件巨兽的专属武器——哪怕只能发射一次。


      机组人员立刻投入工作。想到能为移动基地配备与其实力相称的武器——比如射程达数公里的高能光束炮——所有人都兴奋不已。


      敌军的要塞在远处若隐若现，仿佛正乞求成为试射的靶子。
    textEng: >-
      Your mobile base has navigated through every type of terrain, overcome every obstacle. It's stronger than its ever been. And all the upgrades done to reactor might make it possible to power one of the Behemoth's own weapons, if only for a single shot.


      Your crew gets to work immediately. They're ecstatic at the prospect of giving the mobile base a weapon worthy of its strength — for example, a high-energy beam with a range of a several kilometres.

      “必须记得我们所做的一切都是为了谁，”你的驾驶员低声对你说，他的声音在嘈杂声中显得很平静。“是为了那些等着我们回家的人。”

      恭喜你，指挥官。这是一场艰难的战斗，但你已成功迫使压迫者撤出首都。这么多年过去，费尔兰终于能掌控自己的命运。


      你和队伍理应好好休整。但若您决定继续征战，仍有许多未竟之业。即便首都已获解放，仍有省份在负隅顽抗，企图阻挡费尔兰自由军的攻势，并寄望于卡斯卡德能扭转乾坤。是时候将这些残存势力彻底赶回去了。

      Congratulations, Commander. It's been a difficult battle, but you've successfully forced our oppressors to withdraw from the Capital. For the first time in years, Fyrland can be in control of its own destiny.


      You and your team have deserved a long rest. But if and when you'd like to continue your campaign, there’s still work to be done. Even with the Capital liberated, there are provinces where the occupation stubbornly persists, attempting to hold the line against the 3F and clinging to the hope that Kaskad will somehow turn things around. It's time to drive their remaining forces back for good.

      驾驶员们一个接一个地把头盔挂在了破损不堪的机甲旁。这么多年来，大家第一次讨论起了回家的计划：去见家人和朋友，也去缅怀那些逝去的战友们。时间仿佛静止，这一刻静谧而真实。战斗结束，费尔兰终于自由了。

      "Thank god. We've been holed up here for a few days," she says. "But Kaskad has been sniffing around, and we don't have the people to survive a direct assault. If you can escort us out of here, it'll give us a chance to restock and regroup."


      She nods towards the person at her side. "We even have a pilot with us, but since you're the ones with the actual mechs, maybe they want to stick with you instead?"

      A pilot points to a spot on the map directly ahead of you: Langset, one of Fyrland's remote outposts, now under Kaskad's command. And, if your Intel can be trusted, home to a mobile base currently undergoing repair.


      It's time to make your move.

    textEng: Langset. Once a remote mine way up in the Hedmark highlands, Kaskad forces repurposed it as a repair yard for some of their larger armoured vehicles. Those were the early days of the occupation. Now, aside from a small patrol, it seems nearly abandoned.

      对边界瀑布的袭击，仅仅是一连串侵略的开端。


      毫无预警、毫无挑衅，卡斯卡德自治领迅速入侵并全面占领了其邻国费尔兰共和国。这场吞并行动残酷而彻底。

      The attack on Boundary Falls was the first of many.


      Without warning or provocation, the Kaskad Dominion swiftly overran their neighbouring country, the Republic of Fyrland. The annexation was brutal and absolute.

      数日之内，费尔兰军队便被彻底击溃，化为遍地的残骸与瓦砾。


      幸存的部队逃散至各处隐蔽角落，仅依靠回收或修复的装备组成抵抗力量，对占领者展开游击作战与秘密行动。


      久而久之，他们便以“费尔兰自由军”（简称“3F”）之名广为人知。

      Within days, Fyrland's military was reduced to scrap and rubble.


      Their surviving forces fled to whatever safe corners they could find. Armed only with salvaged or rebuilt equipment, they worked together to form a resistance, engaging in covert and guerrilla warfare against their occupiers.


      Over time, they became known as the "Fyrland Freedom Forces", or the "3F".

      虽然兵力不断缩减，他们的胜利仅是昙花一现。但自由军掌握着卡斯卡德所没有的一项优势：从边界瀑布抢救出的预测技术原型。


      这些原型设备被交付给了少数机甲驾驶员。凭借这项技术，他们能够以近乎超凡的精准与速度打击压迫者。
    textEng: >-
      With dwindling numbers, their victories were short-lived. But the 3F had one thing that Kaskad didn't: the prototype prediction technology that had been saved from Boundary Falls.


      These prototypes were entrusted to a small group of mech pilots, who could use it to strike at their oppressors with seemingly supernatural precision and speed.

      要冒险使用这唯一的优势，他们必须等待最佳时机。过去三年，他们一直隐藏着自己，等待着反击的机会。


      而这个机会，就是今天。

      To risk their one advantage, the time had to be right. For the last three years, they have remained hidden, waiting for their opportunity to fight back.


      That opportunity is today.

      随着最后一个据点被攻陷，敌军已全面撤退。费尔兰自由军正在建立防线，并决定自此守卫该省。来自附近城镇的庆祝消息不断传来。


      虽然仍有多个任务有待完成，但那是以后的事了。机组人员们士气高涨，也期待着应得的修整。附近的抵抗军前哨是个不错的停靠点。

      With the last stronghold falling, the enemy is in full retreat. Fyrland Freedom Forces are setting up defenses and will hold the province from here on out. Reports of celebrations in nearby towns are coming in.


      There is still much to be done, but that can come later. Your crew is in good spirits and is looking forward to a well deserved rest. A resistance outpost nearby should be a good place to stop.
